1
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:03,735


2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:06,605


3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:09,585


4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:12,285


5
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:13,980


6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,600
Good job, Namtaan.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,040
You’ve made significant progress in developing your potential

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,460
This is a tear

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,940
Mr. Chanon Taweepong.

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,660
He was in classroom one when he enrolled in the Gifted Program

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,320
He’s a Gifted student in my year.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,940
Do you remember his signature?

13
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,660
It was signed by Mr. Pom’s pen

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,340
Are you saying Mr. Pom is hiding something from us?

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,680
P’ Chanon didn’t resign

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,660
He found out the secret of the school.

17
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,480
Namtaan!

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,400
After I went in the warehouse, I passed out immediately

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,580
I didn’t see anything.

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,660
The Director has selected the Head Student

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,279
It was Punn

22
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,020
If you’ve read fictions about kids with superpowers,

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,520
you’d know that the storylines are not much different.

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,660
It starts with a kid living in a boring world

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,300
She herself is boring. Her words are boring.

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,820
Everything is so boring

27
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,420
Aren’t you bored listening to the story of a dorky girl

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,460
who overused her power and got a seizure?

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,520
What’s that? What happened?

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,280
Oh my gosh. Boring!

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
All of you should join different clubs to develop your potential

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,539
based on your interest.

33
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,500
I want to join the Nursing Club

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,260
Why don’t you join a Detective Club?

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,600
Isn’t poking your nose in other’s business your kind of fun?

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,259
Can I join the Joke Club?

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,200
How about the morgue?

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,740
That’s where all your jokes end up.

39
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,280
Is it okay to not have any club?

40
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,520
Is it okay to not have charisma?

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
There’s a long list of things you don’t have.

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,800
Anyone else would like to join a club?

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,520
Ahem, I do.

44
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,179
You’ve seen enough of boring villains

45
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,240
Allow me to take you on a sassy journey

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,920
of the sassiest Gifted student.

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,900
I will join the Drama Club

48
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,759
Cue the music

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,480


50
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:03,515


51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300


52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
Hi everyone, my name is Best.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,540
I’m the Director

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,280
I want everyone to introduce themselves

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,740
and give a line that you prepared

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,560
We’ll go by a numerical order

57
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,420
Let’s start with the prince.

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,760
Okay, go.

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,560
Hi, my name is Fluke from classroom 4/7.

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,740
All heroines have dreams.

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,680
For me, it’s acting

62
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,960
even though I have to use my potential to the best of my ability

63
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,820
And my potential is

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,100
seeing everyone’s feelings.

65
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,940
My dearest Princess Vivienne.

66
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,840
People’s feelings manifest themselves to me in colors.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Yellow means confidence.

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,299
Orange means happiness.

69
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,040


70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,740
Now, for the role of the princess

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,260
Purple means fear.

72
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,039
My superpower enables me to understand how others feel

73
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,860
If you’re this scared, you should just go home and cry like a baby.

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,940
And use it to destroy my competition effectively

75
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,080
No one will stand in my way.

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320


77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,700
The rising star now is Clair from the Gifted Program

78
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,800
This one.

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,900
Finally, I, Vivienne, was crowned Queen of the White City

80
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,800
I have entitled the honors and power

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,060
Wrong!

82
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,280
Honors and rights, not power.

83
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,000
Entitled the honors and rights

84
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,500
It’s just a coronation speech

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,340
Is it necessary to follow the script word by word?

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,920
Hey, Cha-em.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,480
If you can’t act, at least do a good job of making the costumes.

88
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Yes, mam.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,260
Like any tale, where there is a princess,

90
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,159
there is a green-eyed monster lurking behind.

91
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,900
Green means jealousy.

92
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,620
Are you all right?

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,640
I’m fine

94
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,180
Pangrum, you are my friend, aren’t you?

95
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,320
I invited you to eat with me during lunch

96
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,400
I talked to the director to get you a supporting role in this play.

97
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,840
Tell me, besides Cha-em, who else here has it out for me?

98
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,200
No one. Don’t assume the worst

99
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,080
Really?

100
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,760
Yes.

101
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,300
No one my ass. This one is green. That one is green.

102
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,780
Sure, if this is how you’re going to play

103
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,820


104
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,060
I know that by being special due to being Gifted and getting the lead role

105
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,280
I can be an object of hatred.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,860
The solution is…

107
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,060


108
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,600
The solution is so easy.

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,680
Love triangle.

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,740
With my potential, within just one week

111
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,380
I’ve gathered all the information of everyone’s feelings about one another.

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,760
The way people with the upper hand deal with those beneath them is

113
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,120
to make them hate one another

114
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,140
Best, you jerk!

115
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,100
The male lead has yet to come out of the closet.

116
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,960
When everyone turns on each other,

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,040
the throne of the White City is securely under my control

118
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,739
I haven’t heard you play this song before

119
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,880
I’ve just tried it today

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160


121
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340
What’s that?

122
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,340
My costume.

123
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,460
I’m getting it fixed

124
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,620
It looks like a shroud

125
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,680
I think it looks fine

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,840
It looks fine but is that enough for a female lead?

127
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Never mind.

128
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,860
By the way, have you told your dad you’re the Head Student?

129
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,219
I’ve texted him, but we haven’t talked.

130
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,860
Don’t be upset. Your dad is not good at expressing his feelings

131
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,080
But trust me, he’s proud of you.

132
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,460
You’re perfect. There’s no reason he won’t be.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,420
How come you know so much about my dad?

134
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,200
You’ve told me, and I remember it all

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,000


136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,720
Your childhood, your family.

137
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,660
Everything you’ve told me is all here in my brain

138
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,400


139
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,980
When will you tell me about yours?

140
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,280
Do you really want to know?

141
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,079
If you want to tell me, I do want to know.

142
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800


143
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:31,985


144
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,365


145
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,525


146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,339
The reason I don’t want to tell my crush about myself?

147
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,320


148
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,280
It’s because I never know what he’s feeling.

149
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,540
He shows a range of colors.

150
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,540
I can never know after he hears my story,

151
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,819
what color it will be.

152
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280


153
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520


154
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,380
I told you the costume can’t be fixed in time.

155
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,200
The play will debut in a few days.

156
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,180
Do you expect Costume to work on yours only?

157
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,420
We have other things to do.

158
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,700
I’m the female lead. My costume should be the most important

159
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,520
Other people’s costumes are important, too.

160
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,619
I don’t know. If the costume isn’t beautiful, I won’t wear it.

161
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,560
And stop asking questions.

162
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,520
If I keep on talking, my facial mask will break

163
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,600
I’m hanging up.

164
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,319
It may sound over the top.

165
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,220
But for a heroine, a beautiful image is the most important

166
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,100
A girl like me cannot be tainted

167
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,600


168
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:37,825


169
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040


170
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
In the Name of the Moon

171
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,980
And this is where the whole story begins.

172
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,000
The person who leaked my photo is in this club.

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,100
I will look at every single person’s feelings
