1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,255


2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:06,505


3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,605


4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:12,305


5
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:14,020


6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,060
Making things disappear is my true potential

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,260
Did you make Folk disappear?

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,060
I can’t even control my own power.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,860
You must bring it back

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,580
You need to feel guilty and want Folk to come back

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,019
Folk, can you hear me?

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,380
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,560
You’re one of those Gifted kids

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,560
Who’s that Gifted kid?

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,480
Every potential has a cause and effect

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,800
Namtaan has a power to know stuff about other people

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,519
because she is a… curious person.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,400
I touched an object and saw strange images.

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,520
It’s a flashback of what the item has been through in the past

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,300
Who’s Medfai?

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,415


22
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,355


23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500


24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,520
How is it going, Namtaan?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,660
This type of indie music… it must be Korn’s

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,100
Next item.

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,380
If you’ve read fictions about kids with superpowers,

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,840
you’d know that the storylines are not much different

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,660


30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,580
It starts with a kid living in a boring world

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,740
until one day everything changes for the better

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,720


33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,539


34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,980
Being left under the bed for so long that it’s covered in dust…

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,740
This must be Ohm’s.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360


37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,320
On to the last one.

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,860
Give it a try.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,260


40
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,380
This one is yours.

41
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,680
It is a gift given to you on your 15th birthday

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,920
You’ve kept it close to you ever since.

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,859
I’ve used this pen for 12 years.

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,260
Good job, Namtaan.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
You’ve made significant progress in developing your potential.

46
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,140


47
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,820
I used to think that it was just an imagination.

48
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,500
Why the numbers are rising so high?

49
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,399
Until the day I had a real superpower.

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,820
Are you hiding anything from me?

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,540
She’d got so much better over the past few years

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,340
Why has she gone back to when she was sick?

53
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,040
What is your Gifted program anyway?

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,519
As I have mentioned to you, Namtaan is gifted

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,920
She’d also had abnormally high blood pressure since she was young

56
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,859
If not controlled properly, she may have a seizure and become paralyzed

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,080
Mom!

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,260
If something worse happens, will it be worth it?

59
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,260
There’s nothing to be worried, I can guarantee

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,660
I opposed the idea since she was transferred here.

61
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,220
As a kid with a superpower,

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,600
I don’t know how high the expectations people have of me are.

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,880
But I have quite a high expectation of myself.

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,780


65
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,280


66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,840
I want to be a doctor.

67
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Not only to cure myself, but I also think that

68
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,200
if I can make it, my mom will be proud.

69
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,420
Can I have an answer that is not the version you give to adults?

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,340
I don’t know.

71
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,320
I used to read a novel

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,640
The heroine is a detective with a psychic power

73
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,539
It was fun but it’s just a novel.

74
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,900
For a special person, whatever she wants to do, she can do it.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,320
Thank you.

76
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,479
Okay, each potential is caused by a different reason

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,340
No matter what it is, the best way to maintain it

78
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,900
is to gain more knowledge through reading.

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,140
I have prepared each of you a list of books to read,

80
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,560
based on your potential and passion

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,100
Claire, why don’t you tell me about your passion?

82
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,520
You may get a few books to read this week.

83
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,700
I don’t have any particular passion.

84
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,520
I just know that I must be famous.

85
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,760
Luckily, I was born in an era when social media can help me with that

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,400
I don’t have to waste time in the library.

87
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,780
Social media makes people narcissists

88
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,020
You can’t make yourself a lead star in a story

89
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,599
if you don’t read enough about it

90
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,659
He may just want to avoid you

91
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,860
Pang! Ohm!

92
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,780
What are you chatting about?

93
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,960
Your friend is speaking. Are you listening?

94
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,099
Let me tell you.

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,080
All Gifted students can be anything they want after they graduate

96
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,919
But those who don’t apply themselves may not graduate

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,460


98
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,385


99
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:53,385


100
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:55,635


101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160


102
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,340
Here are your books.

103
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,479
Why do I have to read so much?

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,920
Don’t complain. You have only 4 books.

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,940
Look at mine. I have 8.

106
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,400
Your ones look much more interesting.

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,520
If I read all of mine, I’d be like Einstein

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:21,880


109
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,000
Our potentials are different.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,240
You focus on physics

111
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,940
But I need to read from myths and folklore

112
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,940
to the cosmos, astronomy and history…

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,260
Stop right there.

114
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,880
Let me go back to my Theory of Relativity

115
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,240
Look at Pang. He hasn’t discovered his potential yet

116
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,780
but he’s much more attentive than you.

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Pang!

118
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,159
Buried deep in your book.

119
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,740
You’re so diligent.

120
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200


121
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760


122
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,300
I thought you’re better than this

123
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,720


124
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,725


125
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,405


126
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,475


127
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360


128
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,320
What?

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,420
I was just playing one game

130
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
You’re looking at me like I’ve killed someone

131
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,839
You didn’t kill anyone but time

132
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,820
Mr. Pom asked us to use this time to discover your potential,

133
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,260
not to play a game.

134
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,220
I just don’t get why he needed us to read so many books

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,500
Not everyone enjoys reading like you do

136
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,420
I know but can’t you just do it for your own future?

137
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,579
How can you be sure that if you do what you’re told,

138
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,540
you will have a bright future?

139
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
What reason do you have not to do it?

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120


141
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,040
You’ve made the effort just to prove your point?

142
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,540
To clear any doubts about the future of our seniors who graduated.

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,540
Hey, it features our photos, too.

144
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,480
This is the latest version.

145
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,780


146
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,180


147
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,120
Why is there only one student in the first class?

148
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,439
Mr. Pom said that the earliest classes would have only 1-2 students.

149
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,060
The number has increased to 10 over the last couple of years

150
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Don’t get dragged into this.

151
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,120
The student from the first year won a gold medal

152
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,520
from the Chemistry Olympiad competition.

153
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,819
She’s come up with a technique to kill cancer cells

154
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,120
and been awarded by the UNESCO.

155
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,700
There are two students from the second year.

156
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,220
One went to study at MIT

157
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,740
and works as a research physical scientist.

158
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,180
The other is a diplomatic attaché in the UK.

159
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,060
The next one is Mr. Porama Wongratana, Year Three, ID: 004

160
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,140
Hey, this is Mr. Pom. He looked like a dork.

161
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,100
Mr. Pom got a Master’s Degree in Neuroscience from Boston.

162
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,920
He became a teacher to help the Director develop our potentials

163
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,540
Next up: Mr. Kamthorn Ratanakachorn, Year Three, ID: 006.

164
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,660
Ethnicity: Thailand, Nationality: Thailand, Religious: Buddhism.

165
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,060
Wait!

166
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,560
What are you doing?

167
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,640
Strange.

168
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,360
The Gifted ID runs sequentially from Year One, doesn’t it?

169
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,040
Why does it skip 005?

170
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,939


171
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,440


172
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,680
Must be a technical error.

173
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,540
That shouldn’t happen with the Gifted Program

174
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,280
What are you doing?

175
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,660
That yearbook is the newest version.

176
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,180
It must have been edited

177
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,359
If we want to know who 005 is,

178
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,740
we need to look at an older version.

179
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,260
Wait, Pang.

180
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,079
I should have believed you

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,860
I shouldn’t have let her drag me into this.

182
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,560


183
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560


184
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,340
Year three falls in Academic Year 2006, right?

185
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes.

186
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,640
We need to find the one published in that year

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,300
Pang!

188
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,380

You’re having too much fun here.

190
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,699
Here it is.

191
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,580
This one was published in 2006

192
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,160
the year Mr. Pom enrolled in this Program

193
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,220
No. 005 may not even exist

194
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,300
This is a tear

195
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,300
Is it possible that the missing page contains the info of 005?

196
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,180
Wait, how is this important?

199
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,119
He was in classroom one when he enrolled in the Gifted Program

200
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,620
Why has his info page been torn off?

201
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,460
You don’t believe he quit the program, do you?

202
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,880
Let’s do something fun.
