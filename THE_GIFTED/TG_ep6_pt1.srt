1
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:03,635


2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:06,595


3
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:09,585


4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:12,275


5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,000


6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,020
Are you okay?

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,980
I’m totally fine. Never mind.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,540
Mon enters the competition, too.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,260
That’s because her potential is limited to sports.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,300
But you black out

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,100
You’re this way because you’ve exercised too much of your potential

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,700
You’re weak.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,560
Get out!

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Weirdo!

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,640
Punn has resigned from his Head Student role

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,200
I have some ideas about what I’ll do as the new Head Student

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,580
"Our heroine wins gold medals in all sports events.
Ms. Patcharamon Pitiwongkorn, M.4/2 (Gifted)."

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,040
Next up is ‘Gossip ‘til We Drop’.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,200
In the latest update, the Gifted Program had a switch

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,700
in the Head Student role

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,800
The main characters are the two students who got in a fight earlier.

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,440
This may intensify the rift within the class even further.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,400
Boom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
Next up, our school is as weird as the weather right now

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,340
The bras of female students are being stolen

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,620
Ms. Ladda can’t find the culprit yet.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,280
What’s wrong with everyone?

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,480
This looks like a zombie movie

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,100
How did it end up like this?

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260


31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,500
Two days earlier

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,280
As you may know, Punn has resigned as the Head Student.

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,460
It is necessary for me to select the new Head Student.

34
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,700
We’ve made the selection based on the list submitted earlier

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,180


36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,360
The new Head Student is ...

37
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,060
Wave

38
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580


39
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,240
Wave, do you want to say something to your friends?

40
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,420


41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,900


42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,400
As the new Head Student,

43
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,680
there’s something I’ve always wanted to do.

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,060
I want to see us improved.

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,480
I want to see everyone develop to their full potential.

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,120
Is this really him?

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,540
First, we need to tie some loose ends

48
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,940
For example, we need to deal with those who ditch the class often.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,100


50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,720
All right, it is him.

51
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,560
Uh huh.

52
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
And those who have yet to discover their potential.

53
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,520
To give a nudge to them to study harder,

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,960
I want those who haven’t discovered their potential

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,580
to maintain the classroom

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,000
and clean the room every day

57
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,519
until they find their potential

58
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,780
Son of a bitch…

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,060
Why are you doing this?

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,080
To motivate them

61
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
If they don’t want to be on the cleaning duty

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,660
they should focus more on finding their potential

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,180
Who knows?

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,100
They may find out their potential is cleaning.

65
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,880
Or they may have already known that they don’t have any potential

66
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,440


67
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,380
This will be a wakeup call for them to realize that they don’t belong here

68
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,800
and resign from the Program.

69
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,300
If you think this will help your friends develop their potentials

70
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,340


71
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,760
we can give it a try.

72
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,360


73
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,060
What the hell?

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,700
Go back to your seat.

75
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,940
Let’s start the class.

76
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,480


77
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,975


78
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,885


79
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460


80
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,860
Oh, the Director

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,240
I’m so sorry

82
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,320
You gave me such a warm welcome.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,420
What brings you here?

84
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,260
I want to talk to Patchamon.

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,400
Mon isn’t in the Gifted class today.

86
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
That’s fine

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,960
What were you upset about?

88
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,340


89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,840
I was quite stressed about my potential

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,940
Why?

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,880
I think that I may not have any

92
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,500
It’s been months and I haven’t found anything

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,580
that could be my potential.

94
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,220
I understand you, Pawaret

95
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,420
But each of us moves at our own pace.

96
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,640
Just because you haven’t found your potential today

97
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,900
doesn’t mean that you don’t have it

98
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,280
The difficulty in finding your potential

99
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,440
may make it greater than anyone else’s once you find it.

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080


101
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,580
I’m not sure about that.

102
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,040
Relax.

103
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,840
You may have been focusing too hard on it.

104
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,800
Try to do what you don’t usually do.

105
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,240
Or talk to your friends

106
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,340
whom you don’t usually talk to.

107
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,000
You may understand more.

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,280
What do you mean?

109
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,500
Our school is as weird as the weather right now.

110
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
The bras of female students are being stolen

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,960
Ms. Ladda can’t find the culprit yet.

112
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
Be careful, girls.

113
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,940
Next up is ‘Gossip ‘til We Drop’.

114
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,540
Come and shower me with gossip

115
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,380


116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360


117
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,720
Let me go!

118
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,680
Let me go!

119
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,440


120
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,820
You startled me.

121
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,080
What do you want with me?

122
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,420
The Director asked me to give this document to you

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,060
And I want to see where you’ve been off to.

124
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,720
Why, do you want to join my club?

125
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,440
I want you to do three things

126
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,620
Duck, kick and run

127
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,300
Huh?

128
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,920
Duck!

129
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260


130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,140
Kick!

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700


132
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020


133
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,759
Run!

134
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,460


135
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,400
We lost again.

136
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,400
What are you guys playing?

137
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,320
Jane set up a bet whether you can knock out

138
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,680
everyone in the club within 10 minutes.

139
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,420
Less than 10

140
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,720
She hasn’t broken a sweat.

141
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,980
As promised, everyone,

142
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,700
Jane will tidy up the gym today.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Congratulations!

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,180
Wait, stop. This is silly

145
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,380
What if I accidently broke someone’s neck?

146
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,500
Calm down,

147
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,420
drink this to cool down

148
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540


149
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,560
Come on, throw it.

150
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,140
I think we should go.

151
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,420
No reason to be the front tire of a tricycle.

152
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
What?

153
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,740
A third wheel

154
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,980


155
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,545


156
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,320


157
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,500
Who’s this?

158
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,680
My friend

159
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,460
So, what are you doing here?

160
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,220
Are you here to join the club?

161
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,840
Not really. I just want to have a look.

162
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,200
We will practice soon.

163
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,680
I’ll show you. Let’s go.

164
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040


165
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,080
Pang, come here.

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,760
This is the practice place

167
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,440
In the National Youth Games,

168
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,240
Coach will send you instead of Jane.

169
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
