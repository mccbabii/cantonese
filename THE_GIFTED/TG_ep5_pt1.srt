1
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:03,635


2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:06,595


3
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:09,585


4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:12,275


5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,000


6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,160
And my potential is seeing everyone’s feelings

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,740
Who else here has it out for me?

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,320
It’s you who leaked the photo

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,340
Let’s just say I have a video clip that you don’t want others to see

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,160
What video clip?

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,900
I’m taking it off.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,340
When you can’t control other people

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,260
why don’t you accept who you are?

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,080
Can you accept if I told you I see you as a good friend?

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,720
I’m okay.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,940
The reason I don’t want to tell my crush about myself?

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,099
It’s because I never know what he’s feeling

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,320
About that clip, I would understand if

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,200
Forget about it

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,080
But you’ve always wanted to know about me

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,180
I do. I think it could be good for our relationship

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,600
Wait, our relationship?

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,520
Hello.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,020
My name is Punn Taweesilp

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,200
I am in M.4, Head Student of the Gifted Program

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,720
Many think I am perfect, but I don’t agree.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,020
I have to say, I’ve never met a student as perfect as you

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,100
The problem is we can’t decide how to utilize this perfection

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,320
in the upcoming Academic Excellence Competition

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,940
What do you say, Mr. Pom?

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,000
Mr. Pom probably wants to hog his Gifted student

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
and doesn’t want him to help us.

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,460
That’s not true.

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,440
I’m willing to have my Gifted students enter this competition.

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,179
But I don’t understand why you all want only Punn

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,820
Wasuthorn can enter the math event.

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,020
But Wave won’t do it.

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,960
It can be any student from other classrooms

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,940
There are other talented students here.

40
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,539
Compete in the Language event

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,500
Math.

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,420
Sports.

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,700
But you like music

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,160
Settle down.

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,020
Why do we make him choose based on his competency?

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,040
Some kid is competent in all the subjects.

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,520
Isn’t that right, Punn?

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040


49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,040


50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,520
Can I compete in all events?

51
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,619
Your father will be so proud, I believe so.

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,640


53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640


54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,119


55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,520
I am highly competent in music and arts

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200


57
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:48,945


58
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,265


59
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:58,795


60
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,125


61
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,225


62
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,480


63
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,919
Can we practice in the actual venue?

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,060
We are the Gifted. Of course, we can.

65
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,980


66
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,695


67
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,425


68
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,565


69
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740


70
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
Perfect.

71
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
The flow wasn’t right at first

72
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,599
The rhythm was a little off towards the end.

73
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,480
We will get there with some practice

74
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,340


75
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:49,415


76
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:51,575


77
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:53,895


78
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:54,965


79
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,660


80
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,520
You forgot one move

81
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,020
What move?

82
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,719
The finale. You didn’t kiss me

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,359
Practice is practice. You can’t just play around

84
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360


85
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,659
Will a little romance kill you?

86
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260


87
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Give it to me.

88
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,960


89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Thank you.

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920


91
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,180
Punn!

92
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820


93
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880


94
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,400
Let’s continue with the practice.

95
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600


96
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,860
I know you’re just pretending to be mad

97
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,460


98
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,340
I don’t want it anymore

99
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Come on

100
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,560
Punn, let go of me.

101
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,680
I won’t… not until…

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,460
Fine, I’m not mad anymore.

103
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,800
No

104
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,820
Not until I want to let go.

105
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900


106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,820
You have a way with words, don’t you?

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,960
Do you like it?

108
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
Yes.

109
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Punn!

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Punn!

111
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Punn!

112
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,340
Where did you go?

113
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,500
It’s almost 7 PM. Let’s call it a day

114
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,080
I have to practice my speech

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480


116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Punn,

117
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,180
I know you’re a super-perfectionist.

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,900
But I want to you enjoy it while you dance.

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,240
Why, don’t I look happy?

120
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,860
Your color clearly tells me you’re under pressure.

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,680
If only there were 72 hours in a day

122
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,500
How about this? Send me your life schedule

123
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,680
I’ll manage it for you.

124
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,780
I’ve got to go.

125
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
Hey, wait. Please sign here.

126
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,459
Punn, are you left-handed?

127
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,440


128
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Yes.

129
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500


130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,360
Let’s talk about a recent tragedy.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,100
An Olympiad gold medalist committed suicide

132
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,640
This is a trending topic in an online community right now

133
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,620
A question has been asked.

134
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,420
Is a talented student often miserable?

135
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,599
Today, we have a chat with a man who can best answer the question,

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,740
Prof. Dr. Premchai Taweesilp,

137
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,260
Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education.

138
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,720
First, I’d like to express my condolences to the deceased’s family.

139
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,300


140
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,680
On the topic of a talented student being miserable,

141
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,439
I’ve been hearing this for years.

142
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,300
And I ask myself, when can we get rid of this 50- year-old myth

143
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,280
about us being a developing country?

144
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,780


145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,900
Japan transformed from a country that lost a war

146
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,240
to a world leader in innovation

147
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,320
How did they do that?

148
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,800
Certainly not because they think talented people are miserable.

149
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,780
Today, we need to stimulate our kids to develop to their full potential

150
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,500
So, they can help develop our country

151
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,600
If we continue with this kind of false thinking,

152
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,040
we will be left behind.

153
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,400
How long can you pretend that your life is so great?

154
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
