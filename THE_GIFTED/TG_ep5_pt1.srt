6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,160
And my potential is seeing everyone’s feelings

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,740
Who else here has it out for me?

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,320
It’s you who leaked the photo

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,340
Let’s just say I have a video clip that you don’t want others to see

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,160
What video clip?

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,900
I’m taking it off.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,340
When you can’t control other people

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,260
why don’t you accept who you are?

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,080
Can you accept if I told you I see you as a good friend?

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,720
I’m okay.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,940
The reason I don’t want to tell my crush about myself?

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,099
It’s because I never know what he’s feeling

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,320
About that clip, I would understand if

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,200
Forget about it

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,080
But you’ve always wanted to know about me

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,180
I do. I think it could be good for our relationship

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,600
Wait, our relationship?

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,520
Hello.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,020
我叫 Punn Taweesilp

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,200
我今年中四，係 Gifted 班嘅學生代表

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,720
好多人認為我好完美，但我唔噉覺得

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,020
我要講，我未見過有個學生好似你咁完美

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,100
但個問題係我哋唔知點樣善用你嘅才能

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,320
嚟緊嘅學術大賽 {*}

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,940
Pom Sir 你講咩話？

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,000
Pom Sir 想霸住 gifted 班嘅學生

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
唔想佢幫我哋

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,460
唔係呀

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,440
我好樂意畀 gifted 班嘅同學去比賽

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,179
但我唔明點解你只要 Punn

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,820
Wasuthorn 可以參加數學比賽

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,020
但 Wave 唔會參加

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,960
可以係其他班嘅同學參加

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,940
其他班都有有才能嘅學生

40
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,539
參加 比賽

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,500
數學

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,420
運動

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,700
但你中意音樂喎

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,160
停

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,020
點解我哋要佢揀？

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,040
有啲人可以參加晒全部比賽

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,520
係咪呀 Punn

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,520
我可唔可以參加晒全部？

51
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,619
我相信你阿爸會為你感到自豪

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,520
我對音樂同藝術好有信心 {*}

63
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,919
我哋可唔可以去比賽場地練習？

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,060
我哋係 Gifted 班嘅學生，緊係可以

70
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
完美

71
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
第一下行錯咗 {*}

72
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,599
尾段唔係好跟到個節奏

73
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,480
我哋練多幾次就得喇

80
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,520
有下你唔記得咗

81
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,020
邊下？

82
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,719
最後，你唔記得錫我

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,359
練習緊嗰陣專心啲，唔好係度玩玩下

85
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,659
浪漫少少你係咪會死呀？

87
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
畀我

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
多謝

91
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,180
Punn ！

94
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,400
繼續練習喇

96
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,860
我知你喺度扮緊嬲

98
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,340
我唔想再嚟喇

99
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
嚟啦

100
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,560
Punn 畀我走啦

101
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,680
唔得，直到...

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,460
好，我唔會再嬲

103
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,800
唔得

104
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,820
我話可以走之前都唔可以走

106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,820
You have a way with words, don’t you? {*}

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,960
你中唔中意？

108
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
中意

109
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Punn！

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Punn！

111
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Punn！

112
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,340
你去咗邊？

113
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,500
就快七點喇，叫做一日喇

114
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,080
我要去練演講

116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Punn

117
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,180
我知你係一個完美主義者

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,900
但我想你跳舞嗰陣你享受嘅

119
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,240
點解，比我望落唔開心咩？

120
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,860
你隻色話我知你好大壓力

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,680
如果一日有72個鐘 {*}

122
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,500
一係噉樣，你 sd 你個行程畀我

123
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,680
我同你度度佢

124
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,780
我要走喇

125
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
等等，喺度簽個名先

126
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,459
Punn，你左囿ga咩? {*}

128
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
係

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,360
嚟講下最近發生咗件好遺憾嘅事

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,100
有位奧運冠軍自殺

132
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,640
呢件事係依家網上最熱門嘅話題

133
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,620
有一個重點問題

134
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,420
天才係咪都好痛苦

135
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,599
今日我哋會同呢個最適合解答嘅男人一齊

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,740
Dr. Premchai Taweesilp 教授

137
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,260
教育局嘅 Deputy Permanent Secretary  {*}

138
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,720
首先，我想同家屬作出深切嘅慰問

140
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,680
對於天才係咪都係痛苦呢個話題

141
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,439
我聽過幾十年

142
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,300
我問過自己點可以解決呢個問題 {*}

143
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,280
about us being a developing country? (*)

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,900
日本由一個戰敗國

146
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,240
去到成為創新力領先世界嘅國家

147
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,320
佢哋係點做到？

148
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,800
一定唔係因為佢哋覺得有能力嘅人係痛苦嘅

149
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,780
依家，我哋要鼓勵嘅細路地發展佢哋所有潛能

150
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,500
令佢哋可以幫助發展國家

151
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,600
如果我哋繼續有呢個錯誤嘅想法

152
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,040
我地會落後

153
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,400
你可以扮生活得好好扮幾耐？
