1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,480
Sorry 我睇唔到你喺度

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,800
我都係，我見唔到你喺度

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,680
我走先喇

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,560
唔該借借

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,200
你，你係咪 Pawaret ？

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,040
你點知㗎？

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,400
恭喜你

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,200
The Gifted Class 度見

9
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,240
The Gifted Class

10
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Mr. Pawaret Sermrittirong

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
四年一班

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,360
Mr. Pakorn Meechoke

13
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,040
媽咪，考試成績出咗喇

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,080
我入咗 The Gifted Class

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,360
冷靜啲，我講真㗎

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
我都唔知點解...

17
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,640
不過 Nac 佢...

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,760
冇嘢喇，係噉啦

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,560
好嘅， bye

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,600
宿舍員工 message 叫你交啲文件 / 宿舍啲人叫你交啲文件

21
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
你下星期就要去 Gifted Student 宿舍住

22
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,360
Nac 我真係唔知點解我會入到 The Gifted Class

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,040
我冇睇過你畀我張貓紙

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,400
我一題都唔識答

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,200
我...

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,360
夠嘞

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
我冇嘢唔洗擔心

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,640
我真係冇嘢喎

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,120
可能下學期又有個測驗

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
你入咗先都好嘅

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
你可以同返我講教咗啲咩

32
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,880
好唔好？

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,080
好多謝你明白

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,440
好嘞，快啲去瞓

35
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,040
可唔可以借支筆？

36
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,720
可以

37
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,080
唔該晒

38
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,480
你係八班嚟嘅？

39
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
你識我？

40
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,160
緊係，你係八班第一個入到 The Gifted Class 嘅學生

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
個個都係度講緊你

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,120
我原本仲驚全班都係一班嘅人

43
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,040
好驚會俾啲書蟲包圍住

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,200
好彩都有其他班嚟嘅人啫

45
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,520
我係二班嘅Ohm

46
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,720
各位同學好

47
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,880
我係 Parama 你哋可以叫我 Mr. Pom

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,600
由今日開始

49
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,680
我會係 The Gifted Class 嘅班主任

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,480
你哋係最出色嘅學生

51
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,560
有特別嘅潛能

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,800
The Gifted Class 有好多規則

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,880
喺櫃桶度有個班章同一份嘢

54
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,320
首先， Class Gifted 係課外輔導班

55
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,600
啫係話你哋平時都要照以前噉返課室上堂

56
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,560
一班嘅同學返去一班上堂

57
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,600
八班嘅同學返去八班上堂

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,680
上完平時啲堂之後，你哋要嚟呢度上堂

59
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,840
由而家開始，大家戴個新徽章

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,680
第二，呢度有好多規則

61
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,880
你哋之後再自己睇

62
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,920
最重要嘅係...

63
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,560
同 Class Gifted 有關嘅嘢

64
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,000
無論點都要同其他人保密

65
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
如果你哋犯咗任何一條都要

66
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,960
即刻離開 Class Gifted

67
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,640
最後

68
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,120
揾出你喺 Class Gifted 嘅原因

69
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,920
我會畀一個星期你哋

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,640
希望你哋享受揾自己潛能嘅過程啦

71
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,680
我希望大家都會揾到答案

72
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
好嘞，重要嘢講完

73
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,440
嚟 test 下你哋先

74
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,240
有冇人知道呢個數字嘅答案係咩？

75
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,880
識答嘅舉手

76
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,880
由嗰日開始，我明白到作為 The Gifted Student

77
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
同普通學生係唔同

78
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,400
Class Gifted 嘅學生係學校有最高地位

79
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,240
你哋可以用比平時更好嘅設備

80
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,480
唔洗受限學校對儀容嘅規則

81
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,440
另外你哋會有自己嘅宿舍

82
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,160
會有定期嘅健康檢查

83
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,360
以上呢啲都係為咗等你哋可以完全發展潛能

84
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,320
我要求你哋 focus 喺揾出你哋嘅潛能度

85
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,840
一開始可能會覺得好難好攰

86
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,480
不過學校已經準備好隨時 support 你哋

87
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Pawaret

88
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,320
最後我希望你哋可以相信呢個班

89
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,000
相信老師

90
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,800
同相信自己

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,920
噉你哋就一定會揾到點解你哋會喺 Class Gifted

92
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Pang 聽我講

93
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,640
入 Class Gifted 個測驗

94
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
係好嚴謹嘅

95
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
校長有親自監測成個過程

96
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
所以絕對唔會出錯

97
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,120
噉點解我覺得我跟唔上其他同學嘅進度？

98
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,440
我睇唔明啲功課講緊咩

99
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
真係咩？

100
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
你唔明咩？

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
Pang 聽我講

102
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
你啲同學都有同一個疑惑

103
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,680
呢一刻我只想你 focus 喺我個問題度

104
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,160
諗下以前發生過嘅事

105
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,400
你可能就會喺入面揾到答案

106
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
你 O 唔 OK？

107
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,960
我冇嘢

108
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,800
呢個幾得意噉

109
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,960
Pang，你帶我嚟 The Gifted Student 個書架

110
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,440
只係為咗揾呢啲咁冇腦嘅書？

111
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,880
唔係啊，呢啲係 Class Gifted 嘅功課嚟

112
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,400
我喺度揾緊喺 Class Gifted 嘅原因

113
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,720
睇呢啲講幻想嘅書會揾到？

114
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,160
你係咪傻咗？

115
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
你做咩啊？

116
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,680
你做繄咩就真？

117
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,680
你又話會同我講 Class Gifted 啲嘢

118
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,280
但你唔見咗影

119
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,160
你都見我返學好忙

120
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,040
忙住睇呢啲冇腦嘅書？

121
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,240
Class Gifted 真係好奇怪

122
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,760
點奇怪？

123
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,600
全部啊，啲同學，老師，教緊嘅嘢

124
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,680
我都唔知點解

125
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,840
愈讀愈覺得似...

126
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
似...

127
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
我好似學緊魔法或者念力

128
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,520
你唔想講嘅唔講都得

129
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
唔洗講大話

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,960
你唔信我講嘅話做咩問我

131
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,680
噉你仔細啲講發生咩事

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,800
我唔可以再講落去

133
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,920
頂你 Pang 我對你好失望

134
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,840
我以為你喺 The Gifted Class 會好畀心機讀書

135
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,360
結果你只係喺到做埋啲冇腦嘢

136
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,000
你究竟點入到 The Gifted Class 㗎？

137
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,320
你唔明㗎喇，你都唔喺 The Gifted Class

138
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
啱啊

139
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,720
你係咪終於發現好似我呢啲咁普通嘅學生唔喺 The Gifted Class？

140
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,160
我唔係噉嘅意思...

141
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,560
Now that you’ve pushed yourself out of a slum,

142
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,560
don’t use your slum manner around here.

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
唔關你事啊 Wave

144
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,720
唔關你事先啱，呢度係 The Gifted Zone

145
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
所以呢？ The Gifted Student 係咪就咁特別？

146
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,000
當然，係好唔同𠻹

147
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,560
唔好唔記得你依家低級過我

148
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,640
記唔記得我話過我會入 The Gifted Class

149
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,880
而你會喺一班繼續畀人依附

150
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
我講嘅嘢依家成真咗

151
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,400
唯一唔同嘅係你依家係依附人嗰個

152
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,240
係咪啊 Pang？

153
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,320
Wave 頂你！

154
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
唔好啊！

155
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
唔好阻止我

156
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,720
噉就跌低？真係弱

157
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,240
起身，起身啊 ，你咁弱㗎咩

158
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,560
發生咩事？

159
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,720
Ms. Ladda，唔該晒你睇住佢哋

160
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,760
不過交畀我就得

161
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,920
我唔覺得你搞得掂佢哋
