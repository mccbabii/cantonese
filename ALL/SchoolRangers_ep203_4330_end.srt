00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,740
This week’s School Ranger has now arrived at its final week of “Intro to Rangers”,

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,320
the missions to improve their skills to become rangers.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,720
They’ll continue competing in the rock-climbing mission to test their body strengths,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,259
followed by an archery mission to check their

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,840
accuracy, as well as their wit to stack various items as high as possible.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,220
The last mission will push them to their limits.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,720
It’s high and can make their stomachs sink!

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,480
How will the final result of “Intro to Rangers” missions turn?

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,239
Which team is going to lose in the end?

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,720
Let’s enjoy them all now!

11
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:18,320
Last week, our 15 rangers had their ranger skills tested.

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,240
The first mission examined their agility.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,960
Team A and Team C were neck and neck, both earning 5 points.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,539
Team B only got 2 points.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,240
The second mission, “Harmony Balance Board” tested their teamwork skills.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,059
The Shoo-In from Team C didn’t do quite well,

17
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,040
resulting in Team A that was previously “out of sight” leading the game.

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,700
Team B still hasn’t made much progress and, hence, ranks last!

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,480
But our missions are not over yet,

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,360
Let’s continue their battle in the ‘Climbing and Guessing’ game.

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,780
This mission tests their body strength.

22
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,320
Each player must climb the boulder to get all the clues.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,179
Then, he must come down and figure out the answer.

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,380
The first round, in ‘A Province’s Signature’ category, has already ended.

25
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,880
Gun, White, and New did amazing jobs in this mission.

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,200
In the second round this week,

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,359
we’re making it more challenging for them by increasing the height.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,020
The clues are English letters.

29
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,940
Rangers must re-arrange them to make a word in a ‘fruit’ category.

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,540
Let's see what the result of this game will be.

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,640
Nanon, how are you feeling now?

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
English is fine,

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,380
but this is not the height we started with, is it?

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,180
SUPER HIGH!!

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,920
In the first round, 
SUPER HIGH!!

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,079
the height was only around half,

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
but this time, clues are placed almost at the top.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,240
FEELING MORE PRESSURED!!
I’m trying not to look up now.

39
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,240
This challenge suits a talented one like you, Nanon.

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,580
OUR TALENTED BOY!!

41
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,960
I’m sure you won’t miss it!

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,820
That is just a BAD BOULDER!
(Word play with BAD BUDDY)

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Chill out.

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Go slowly.

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,640
Nanon is now climbing with determination.

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,779
LOOKS NICE!!

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,160
It’s ‘E’.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,620
He’s already got the first letter.

49
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,720
Move to the red one.

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,340
Which red?

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,660
Your right leg.
CONFUSED.

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,060
Go up.
CONFUSED.

53
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,460
CONFUSED.

54
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,480
He’s only got one letter, but now he doesn’t know which direction to go on anymore.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,420
Faster. It’s fine if you fell.

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,179
Don’t listen to him.

57
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,840
Listen to me.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
THEY’RE ARGUING ALREADY!!
We have both impatient and calm senior rangers here.

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,780
Who should he believe?

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,240
I’m already thirsty.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,020
EXHAUSTED ALREADY!!
To your left.

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
It seems his arms are exhausted, and so are his legs.
EXHAUSTED ALREADY!!

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,200
It seems his arms are exhausted, and so are his legs.

64
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,980
Poor him.

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,700
You’d better take in all support from your senior rangers now!

66
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,660
With your left leg.

67
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,120
Alright.

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,780
Smile.

69
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,960
Look at the camera on your left.

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,820
He finally reached the second letter.

71
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,480
Grape!
FIGURE OUT THE ANSWER ALREADY!!

72
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,840
GRADUALLY MOVING UP

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,720
Good job, bro.

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,140
LOTS OF SUPPORT DOWN HERE!
Good job, bro.

75
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,000
If your legs are tired, then rest first.
LOTS OF SUPPORT DOWN HERE!

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,660
You might fall down.
LOTS OF SUPPORT DOWN HERE!

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,200
That’s fine. I’m down here ready to take you.

78
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,539
Nanon finally gets his energy back,

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,740
now reaching the third clue.

80
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,320
That’s “P”.

81
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,380
To your left.

82
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,080
Alright.

83
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,080
WHICH MOVE SHOULD I MAKE?

84
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Relax.

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,680
Alright.

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,420
Your right leg.

87
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,880
Left.

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,300
It’s difficult.

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,540
The higher he climbs,	the more difficult it becomes.
IT’S NOT A PIECE OF CAKE!!!

90
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,080
The higher he climbs,	the more difficult it becomes.

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,979
If he chooses the wrong move,then the game could change.

92
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,520
It’s not easy at all to get the fourth letter.

93
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,060
Wait.

94
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,400
Use your legs.

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,679
MORE EXCITED THAN ANYONE ELSE!!

96
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,940
Push.

97
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,620
PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER FOR A SECOND!!

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Trying to reach the last letter could make his stomach drop!

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,340
He’s just one step away,

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,940
but all his team members are freaked out already.

101
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,040
Left.

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,300
In your front, Nanon.

103
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,260
EVERY MOVE IS SO SOUL-STIRRING!!
In your front, Nanon.

104
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,460
EVERY MOVE IS SO SOUL-STIRRING!!

105
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,940
Throw it down.

106
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,460
Come down now.

107
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,520
He’s finally got the fifth letter.

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,020
Come down here.

109
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,520
Since he’s already got all the letters,	it’s time to hurry down and write the answer confidently.

110
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,960
Press the button.

111
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,640
G-R-A-P-E

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,520
Grape.

113
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,280
Nanon, you’re amazing.

114
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,700
They told me to use my legs’ strength to step on it,

115
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,180
but it’s super small.

116
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,700
I could just stand on it.

117
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,979
It didn’t help push me up.

118
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,980
I just tried to balance myself on it and relied on my hands’ strength.

119
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,340
I just stand here, witnessing their success.

120
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,020
SUPER PROUD!!
I just stand here, witnessing their success.

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
SUPER PROUD!!
It’s like when their series become a top hit.

122
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,160
Now, it’s time for Chimon from Team B.

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,800
How are you feeling right now?

124
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,960
My hands are wet already.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,460
I haven’t even started.

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,820
FILLED WITH SWEAT!!
Did you just get your hands washed?

127
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,099
I’m just excited.

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,099
He did watch his hands in advance.

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,540
Who do you think will be faster?	Chimon or Nanon?

130
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
I don’t even have to figure out the answer.	It’s Chimon, of course.

131
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,100
LET’S SEE WHO’S GONNA WIN!!

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,800
Let’s dope.

133
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,140
His first step is smooth,and his second move is still agile.

134
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,260
It seems he’s doing well.

135
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,340
It seems he’s doing well.
It seems he’s doing well.

136
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,500
Relax.
Climb as a mountain goat does.

137
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,180
Go slowly on the side.

138
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,340
His first moves were epic,	but now he’s failing.

139
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,960
THAT’S THRILLING!!

140
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,380
It’s alright.

141
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Relax, bro.

142
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,760
HE KEEPS GOING!

143
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,280
After regaining his confidence,

144
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
he’s finally reached the first letter.

145
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,900
It’s “M.”

146
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,719
Mango!

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,320
GUESS IN ADVANCE!

148
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,920
It’s “N.”

149
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,820
He continues moving up, aiming at the second letter.

150
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,680
THAT’S A SMOOTHER CLIMB!!
He continues moving up, aiming at the second letter.

151
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,000
This is a challenging spot.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,400
Which way should he choose?

153
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,659
If you never try,
CONFUSED ALREADY!!
Which way should he choose?

154
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,620
then you’ll never know!	Try it and you’ll understand.
CONFUSED ALREADY!!

155
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,280
then you’ll never know!	Try it and you’ll understand.

156
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,219
How is it going, dude?

157
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,200
HE CAME TO REALIZE!!
It’s difficult!

158
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,520
HE CAME TO REALIZE!!
I told you!!

159
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,820
HE CAME TO REALIZE!!

160
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,620
It seems he still has enough energy.

161
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,040
He’s already reaching the third letter.

162
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,140
But his legs are shaking now.

163
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,120
He is physically, but not mentally exhausted.

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
HE’S NOT GIVING UP!!
He is physically, but not mentally exhausted.

165
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,460
He’s trying his best.
HE’S NOT GIVING UP!!

166
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,239
He’s trying his best.

167
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,240
Though his gesture doesn’t look quite nice,

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,340
he has already managed to grab the fourth letter.

169
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,979
Go right.

170
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,700
Nope.

171
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,860
Step on that same right one.
WHICH WAY SHOULD HE GO?

172
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,580
Your left.
WHICH WAY SHOULD HE GO?

173
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,120
He’s trying to reach the last letter now.

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,620
It takes quite long though.

175
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,060
Rangers down there are really rooting for him.

176
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,120
Left.

177
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,820
Straight up.

178
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,000
That’s right.

179
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,200
Right.

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,460
EVERY MOVE IS THRILLING!!

181
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,880
It’s “A”

182
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,800
A BIT OUT OF BALANCE!!

183
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,539
Use your feet to push.
A BIT OUT OF BALANCE!!

184
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,459
Use your feet to push.

185
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,160
He’s finally down here with achy legs.

186
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
CHILL OUT, BOYS!!

187
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,660
M-A-N-G-O

188
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,460
Press the button.

189
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,920
Hey, don’t just leave Chimon behind after getting the answer.

190
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,880
His legs are too weak now.	Bring him along.

191
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,900
Chimon, is there anything you want to say to Nanon?

192
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,560
I nailed it, little bro.

193
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,100
It’s not easy at all.

194
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,500
FULL OF SWEATS!

195
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,620
You see there’s no sign of fear in his eyes.	There’s none.

196
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,300
But his hands…

197
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,160
A BIG EVIDENCE HERE!
After I came down,

198
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,860
I didn’t have any strength to even hold a pen to write.

199
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,640
That required lots of energy.

200
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,420
White did help me.

201
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,500
A NICE BROTHER
White did help me.

202
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,440
I also did.	I told you to climb as a mountain goat does.

203
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,640
It usually climbs on the side.

204
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,160
Have you ever seen it?

205
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,339
I didn’t listen to Tay at all.

206
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,620
A MOUNTAIN GOAT IS NOT COMING HERE.

207
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,540
I only listened to White.

208
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,160
Mond Tanutchai is our last contestant.

209
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,700
He’s from Team A.

210
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,760
He’s representing Team B.

211
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,360
Team C!

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,740
He’s the last contestant from Team C.

213
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,740
That’s already correct!

214
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,540
Seeing how your two friends did,

215
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
how are you feeling now? Nervous?

216
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,579
I’m not really worried

217
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,860
because it took them quite long to complete the mission.

218
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,040
BRAGGING!!

219
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,580
HE’S EXTRAORDINARY!!

220
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,200
I won the Climbing Award Championship in 2019.

221
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,359
How old were you in 2019?

222
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,540
That happened in my dream.

223
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,219
Bear in mind.

224
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,599
I didn’t earn the title ‘King Kong’ easily.

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
#KINGKONGMOND

226
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,300
When the start sound rings,

227
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,060
Mond’s adrenaline is flooding all around.

228
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,800
Since he has a long body and is shaped with strength,

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,620
CLIMBING!!

230
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,540
he relies only on his arms to balance himself.
CLIMBING!!

231
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,839
he relies only on his arms to balance himself.

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,720
HE’S USING HIS ARMS TO CLIMB!!
he relies only on his arms to balance himself.

233
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,160
SPEECHLESS!!

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
He’s not using his legs at all.
SPEECHLESS!!

235
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,880
It’s “C”.

236
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,660
SUPER FAST!!
He’s got the first letter so fast,

237
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,520
It’s “A”.

238
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
and then quickly grabbed the second letter.

239
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,400
What kind of creature is he?

240
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,420
CONTINUE GOING UP!!

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,300
It’s “E.”

242
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,939
He’s effortlessly revealed the third letter.

243
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,520
He’s dancing while climbing too.

244
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,140
He can still dance up there.

245
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,720
Well, he just missed one step.

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,880
Though his legs can’t help him for now,

247
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,660
USING ONLY HANDS IS ENOUGH!!
his hands are still so helpful in pushing him up there.

248
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,819
his hands are still so helpful in pushing him up there.

249
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,900
RESPECT!!

250
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,900
It’s “H.”

251
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,060
He’s now reached the fourth letter.

252
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,760
He is stopping there to show a cool pose,=

253
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,140
before revealing the last letter.

254
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,280
He’s so amazing.

255
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Come down with a cool pose, please.

256
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,160
A song, please!

257
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,680
That was almost rad!

258
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,939
Just come down simply then.

259
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,380
His answer is P-E-A-C-H!

260
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,260
Hurry up!

261
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,380
TOO BUSY WITH ACTING COOL

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,100
I danced up there for a while

263
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,940
since I thought I climbed too fast.

264
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
KEEP ON BRAGGING!

265
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,420
Actually, I could have finished even more quickly,

266
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,260
but I didn’t want to since I’m afraid my bros will be sad.

267
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,660
THAT’S HOW THE STORY GOES.

268
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,900
In fact, I should have asked the staff to lower other teams’ goal position a bit,

269
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,260
THE REAL GEM HERE!!!
I see

270
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,160
You’re not a human.

271
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,580
Look at their faces.

272
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,620
TOO GOOD!!
Look at their faces.

273
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,000
Look at their faces.

274
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,319
What we’re envious of is that you can use your arms normally after coming down.

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,060
We can’t use ours now.

276
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,560
Ours are still shaking.
CAN’T

277
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Our hands still feel achy now.

278
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
I’m not sure if you can see my sweat here.
They’re wet.

279
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,120
Now, let’s reveal our result for the first round of the ‘Climbing and Guessing’ game,

280
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,880
in ‘A Province’s Signature’ category.

281
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
The fastest ranger is...

282
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,280
New,

283
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
followed by Gun,

284
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,620
while White is the slowest.

285
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,219
CLIMBING AND GUESSING GAME
‘A PROVINCE’S SIGNATURE’ CATEGORY.

286
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,240
In the second round, ‘Fruit’ category,

287
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,680
The fastest ranger is…

288
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,680
Mond,

289
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,500
followed by Chimon.

290
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,880
Nanon is the slowest.

291
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,199
CLIMBING AND GUESSING GAME
‘FRUIT’ CATEGORY.

292
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,700
Team C, known for their strength, won two rounds in a row.

293
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,540
They have earned the highest point as expected.

294
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,560
The other two teams share an equal point.

295
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,579
That much?

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,480
Just look at their bodies.

297
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,500
Now, Team C and Team A are taking turns leading.

298
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
They are neck and neck.

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
It’s now 15: 14.

300
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Team B with 9 points still has a chance to earn more in the next game.

301
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,860
Let’s see if they can catch up with the other two teams.

302
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,760
The next mission is a combination of accuracy and wit.

303
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,380
See you after a short break.

304
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,000
You’re still with us in School Rangers: ‘Intro to Rangers’ missions.

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,980
Let’s take a break from the previous mission which focused on strength.

306
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,060
This mission will test their concentration and planning skills.

307
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,780
This is the last mission to decide which team is going to lose and get punished.

308
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,319
Here we are on our final mission.

309
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,740
In this mission, we really need to use our wits.

310
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,020
Who do you think will do well in this mission?

311
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,600
I think that goes to Off.He is good at concentrating and planning.

312
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,520
My skill is just so-so.

313
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
I’m not going to act cool now.

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,680
CHOOSE TO BE HUMBLE!!
Tay, what about you?

315
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,860
Are you sharp-witted?

316
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,920
Yes.

317
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,060
How?

318
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,319
That’s a wink, not a wit.

319
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,960
I see.

320
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,060
Let's see our rule.

321
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,760
‘SHOOT WELL, MAKE IT HIGH’

322
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,740
In each round, each ranger must shoot an arrow to hit the target.

323
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,760
Each target has number 3, number 2, and number 1 written.

324
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,280
If any ranger misses the target, then his point automatically goes to 0.

325
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,040
Next, rangers will take turns choosing various items

326
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,819
How many items they can choose depends on the number they hit.

327
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,140
All items will be gathered in each team.

328
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,300
After every ranger in every team has completed their turn,

329
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:15,680
each team must have all their items piled up to be as high as possible within just 45 seconds.

330
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,239
The team that builds the highest pile wins.

331
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,120
Who goes first, second and last matters a lot in this mission

332
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,820
because it could change the result!

333
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,380
Let’s see!

334
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,560
Team B goes first, followed by Team C and Team A, respectively.

335
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,380
They will shoot arrows and pick items based on this order.

336
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,540
Each ranger picks one item at a time and waits for the next turn in order.

337
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,040
Will I hit the target?

338
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,719
Is there anyone here who has done archery before?

339
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,520
We have to ask Mond when it comes to skills.

340
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,800
He was teaching me just now.

341
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
Tell them what you just taught me.

342
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,120
Skills can’t be taught

343
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,580
because I grew up in the forest.

344
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,920
HERE COMES THE FOREST KING!!
I did archery to hunt since childhood.

345
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,020
You go back to your forest today then.

346
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,239
Don’t go back to Bangkok.

347
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,580
Anyone else has an archery skill?

348
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,760
Nanon is good at shooting.

349
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,100
Are you good at archery?

350
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,160
I’m the best.

351
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,319
THE BEST IN EVERYTHING!!!

352
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,300
I’m telling you now that I’m the best in archery.

353
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,900
Nobody here can beat me.

354
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
Marvel Studio almost contacted me to join their movie.

355
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
ALWAYS THE BEST ONE!!

356
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,460
Marvel Studio almost contacted me to join their movie.

357
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,200
HE HAS GONE TOO FAR!!

358
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,100
What about Team B?

359
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,680
Mix is known for archery.
M:	You’re right.

360
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,400
Archery?

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,220
For real?

362
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,180
I mean Ping Pong.

363
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,000
HIS JOKE IS GETTING BETTER ALREADY!!

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He starts to crack jokes.

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,500
That’s funny.

366
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,579
Laugh.

367
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
To do archery…	I will teach you all.

368
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,160
THIS IS THE REAL GEM!!
We must listen to him.

369
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,480
There must be a right gesture.

370
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,520
Show us.

371
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,500
I’ll show you.

372
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,520
Today, I won’t shoot like this.

373
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,020
WHISPER A JOKE TO CRACK!!
Today, I won’t shoot like this.

374
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,360
I’ll turn my back

375
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,200
and go like this.

376
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,840
This is how I’m going to shoot.
A DIFFICULT POSE!!

377
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,140
Nicky, were you about to say something?	In the past, you did what?

378
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,140
In the Lord of the Rings, I taught Legolas.

379
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,740
You taught him how to practice archery?

380
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,640
Of course!

381
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,980
When I grew up,

382
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,920
I thought Robinhood.

383
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,020
Archery?

384
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,319
HE RUINS HIS JOKE!!

385
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,620
Since everyone is ready now,

386
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,080
Let the game begin!

387
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,079
The first ranger is White from Team B.Good luck!

388
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,600
HE MISSED IT!!

389
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,000
Well, he hit it.
HE MISSED IT!!

390
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,339
Well, he hit it.

391
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,439
Not the target, but the straw in the back!

392
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,340
He’s probably too excited.
A:	It’s alright.

393
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,800
You did well.

394
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,440
ACT BOLD!!

395
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,180
What a regret! That was so close to getting 3.

396
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,740
But at least he hit number 2.

397
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,940
Why are you so vain, huh?

398
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,300
I’m excited.

399
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,460
NERVOUS

400
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,960
He said he’s not confident,

401
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,560
but he didn’t disappoint us.

402
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,600
Gun hit right at number 2.

403
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,920
GREAT JOB!!

404
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
Which one do you think is the most useful?

405
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,580
A table or?

406
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,320
A table is.

407
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,200
If we put a podium on top of a table.	then it’s our victory.

408
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,220
HE’S LONG-HEADED!!
Only two items.

409
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,720
HE’S LONG-HEADED!!

410
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,400
What about a bicycle?

411
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,460
It’s high.

412
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,200
Why bicycle?

413
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,420
It can’t be piled up with other items.
ACT SERIOUS.

414
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
We need to extend it to be as high as possible.

415
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,720
Then, we put a basket on the top.

416
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
A STRATEGY PLANNER!!
Then, we put a basket on the top.

417
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:24,900
A STRATEGY PLANNER!!

418
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,340
What are you targeting in mind?

419
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,699
It seems our MC has his choice in mind.

420
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,080
He chose this light tripod stand.

421
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,500
THIS ONE IS LIT!!
He chose this light tripod stand.

422
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,520
I think we can extend it quite high.
THIS ONE IS LIT!!

423
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,540
I think we can extend it quite high.

424
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,260
This item is such a useful one

425
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,540
because they can pull it out quite long.

426
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,300
There’s another one similar to what Mond just chose.

427
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,000
We don’t need it, do we?

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,300
There’s another tripod, isn’t it?

429
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,020
Alright.

430
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,960
If we can get a table, a podium, and a tripod,	then we’re all set.

431
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,840
True.

432
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,820
Team A wants to make sure that their base is strong enough,

433
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,100
so they chose a podium with light.

434
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,680
It’s Team C’s turn again.

435
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,340
This time, he chose a tripod before A team gets to take it!

436
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,879
He’s not giving it to us.

437
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,360
THEY SNATCHED IT!!
He’s not giving it to us.

438
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,200
THEY SNATCHED IT!!
I picked this tripod to minimize Team A’s chance,

439
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,260
I picked this tripod to minimize Team A’s chance,

440
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,480
so they can’t make their plie high.

441
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,180
A COMPLICATED TACTIC!!!
Let me show you that it can be extended this long.

442
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,180
If we have one tripod standing on each side, it will look nice.

443
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,460
A table is a good choice though.

444
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
We’ll put a table on the top.

445
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,460
ARE YOU SURE?!!
We should get the base first.

446
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,340
Don’t let them get it.

447
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,500
FEEL LIKE TAKING A REVENGE!!
Let’s get the table.

448
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,640
A wooden table.

449
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,800
Team A chose this table.

450
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,360
We can do it.

451
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,899
READY TO TAKE REVENGE!
Don’t let Team C get it.

452
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,800
Don’t let Team C get it.

453
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,300
It seems they’re having fun.

454
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,820
LONELY HERE!!

455
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,020
We’re also having so much fun.
---
LONELY HERE!!

456
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,520
LONELY HERE!!

457
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,540
He’s so determined that we can’t help getting tensed too.

458
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,260
He hit the border of the number 1 area.

459
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,760
He almost missed it though.

460
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,980
He made a slight flick when starting to shoot.

461
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,280
His arrow went up to the number 1 area.

462
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,740
This ranger from our team is extraordinary.

463
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,320
COMPLIMENTING HIS TEAMMATE!!

464
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,439
He’s good at everything.
COMPLIMENTING HIS TEAMMATE!!

465
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,560
HE’S SO DETERMINED!!

466
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,680
WHAT A REGRET!!

467
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
That was a bit too low.

468
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
He still hit the target anyway,

469
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,800
but that was so close to number 2.

470
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,960
He got 1.

471
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Not bad.

472
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,940
Nice job.

473
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
We’re all getting an equal point.

474
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,020
Team B gets to choose first.

475
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,280
ALL ARE CONFUSED!!¬

476
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,360
I will use it to cover my face.

477
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,200
IS HE COMPETING TO BE THE FUNNIEST RANGER?

478
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,540
GET BACK TO OUR MISSION FIRST!

479
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,720
Let’s choose the table.

480
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,260
They end up choosing this table.

481
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,400
Team C also picked a table.

482
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,720
Are you guys copying each other?

483
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,820
Open it to see if it works.

484
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,740
Team A is considering different tables.

485
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
THEY REALLY THINK IT THROUGH!!
Team A is considering different tables.

486
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,080
THEY REALLY THINK IT THROUGH!!

487
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,439
I think we should build with small items to make our pile high.

488
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,760
It can’t be leaned.

489
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,500
Let’s go with a broom then.

490
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,240
A broom.

491
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,560
We should choose the longest stick.
WHAT A UNIQUE CHOICE!!

492
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Let’s get a broom.

493
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,480
They finally end up with a broom.

494
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,400
Look at him.

495
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,900
His shooting pose is already epic.

496
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,280
WHAT A DETERMINED ONE!!

497
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,640
He’s biting his lips.

498
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
That was close again,

499
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,720
but when we look closely, it’s obvious he gets 2.

500
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,420
He hit number 2.

501
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,199
GOOD AT TEASING!!

502
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,380
Super cool.

503
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,840
YOUR BRO IS SO COOL.
Super cool.

504
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,659
YOUR BRO IS SO COOL.

505
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,420
Off has such a cool gesture,

506
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,820
but…that failed! He missed the target.

507
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,060
His arrow went straight down to the ground.

508
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,620
It’s alright.

509
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,899
You still look cool, Off.

510
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,980
Let’s get it!

511
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,940
I won’t disappoint you.

512
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,980
He’s shooting with confidence.

513
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,680
His arrow hit number 1.

514
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,720
They took all tables!!
Team B chose a table again.

515
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,520
Should we get a chair first?

516
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,300
Let’s take it.

517
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,379
I think it works.

518
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:10,660
GREAT IDEA!!!
I think it works.

519
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,580
GREAT IDEA!!!
Take it.

520
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,139
We go with this one.
GREAT IDEA!!!

521
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,160
My team likes something big.

522
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,960
Team A chose a bench,

523
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
but they put it up straight like this.

524
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,380
It’s Team B’s turn again.

525
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,880
They took one more table like the one they previously picked.

526
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,800
THEY ARE COLLECTING TABLES FOR SURE!!
They took one more table like the one they previously picked.

527
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,160
Though it’s kind of thrilling when he started to shoot,

528
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,840
Mix’s arrow hit number 1.

529
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,320
The way he shot was so shocking.
THAT WAS BREATHTAKING!!

530
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,040
THAT WAS BREATHTAKING!!

531
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,260
NICE POSE!!

532
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,540
He did great as usual, hitting right at number 1.

533
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,760
This ranger gets so tensed

534
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,360
all over his face and even his tongue.

535
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,320
But that was a nice shot.

536
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,460
He hit number 2!

537
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,960
SHOW THE KIDS HOW TO SHOOT!!

538
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,920
Legolas!

539
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,460
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

540
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,100
Next, let’s choose a broom.

541
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,980
THEY HAVE PLANNED IT WELL!!
Team B picked a water gallon.

542
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,800
THEY HAVE PLANNED IT WELL!!

543
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,340
It seems this team is having a great idea.

544
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,460
Team C chose a packaging box.

545
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:30,980
THAT’S KIND OF WEIRD!!
Team C chose a packaging box.

546
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,180
THAT’S KIND OF WEIRD!!

547
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Leo, you pick a water gallon first.
Well, is that their strategy, huh?

548
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,760
Water gallon.

549
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,100
Let’s get these two.

550
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,219
Team A can choose two items this time.

551
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,340
Leo chose a basket and a water gallon.

552
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,320
HE IS REALLY FOCUSED!!
Leo chose a basket and a water gallon.

553
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,080
These items seem to go along well.
HE IS REALLY FOCUSED!!

554
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,199
These items seem to go along well.

555
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,600
He’s compressing his lips to boost energy.

556
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,520
It’s that position again!

557
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,960
This is for sure a cursed spot.

558
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,480
THAT’S SO CLOSE!!
This is for sure a cursed spot.

559
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,260
Many rangers hit this same spot.

560
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,040
You got number 1, Chimon.

561
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,480
He shook a bit at last,

562
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,220
so his arrow shifted upward to the border.

563
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,220
He almost missed it.

564
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,420
That was a soul-stirring shot, earning him 1.

565
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,020
WHAT A STUNNING LOOK!!

566
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,460
Two.

567
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,000
Nicky’s shooting skill almost earned him 3.

568
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,820
That was super close.

569
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,399
That’s in the number 2 area.

570
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Today, our senior rangers are doing an amazing job.

571
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,699
Team B chose a broom as planned.

572
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,180
THEY HAVE GOT ALL THE ITEMS AS PLANNED!!
Team B chose a broom as planned.

573
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,260
It seems they’re planning to put it in the water gallon.

574
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
Team C also chose a broom.
LET ME FOLLOW YOU.

575
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,179
Brooms are selling well.Every team got one.

576
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,760
Yellow one and green one.

577
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,180
AN EXPERT!!
Yellow one and green one.

578
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
The green one isn’t strong, is it? Let’s check.
AN EXPERT!!

579
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,300
Is it strong?

580
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,860
We can do something with its bottom.

581
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,400
Take it, shall we?

582
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,360
What about a yellow one?

583
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,000
Alright.

584
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,680
Team A that got to choose two items this time is picking a short table and a one-layer shelf.

585
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,400
It can be used either vertically or horizontally.

586
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,540
[A SUMMARY OF ITEMS EACH TEAM HAS GOT]

587
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,080
Our team hit the target many times,	so here we are with lots of items.

588
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,280
And then?

589
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,160
Then, we’re kind of worried,

590
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,160
seeing other teams with just a few items.

591
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,260
HE GOES ON BOASTING!!!
Are they lonely?

592
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,600
The only thing we’re afraid of s that ours will be so high that it reaches the cloud.

593
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,320
EVEN REACHES THE SKY!!
You know that could be dangerous,

594
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,860
so we’re thinking about how to make it properly high.

595
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,260
We’re having enough tables for everyone in our team,

596
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,740
so we can sit and watch the other two teams competing.

597
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,240
Nope.

598
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,940
We will stack these three tables.

599
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,220
Then, we will put a water gallon straight up and put a broom in.

600
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,940
We will add uniqueness to ours with that.

601
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,740
THEY HAVE A TRICK!!
Right.	That’s the best we can do.

602
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,320
For our team, it seems we have just a few items, right?

603
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,080
That’s because we’ve carefully selected them.

604
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,300
ALL ARE AMAZING ITEMS!!
That’s because we’ve carefully selected them.

605
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,880
That’s right.
ALL ARE AMAZING ITEMS!!

606
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,980
We will lay the table vertically

607
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,840
HE HAS PREPARED STEPS.

608
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,260
HE HAS PREPARED STEPS.
A broom will be added.Then, we have a packaging box on top again.

609
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,180
My job is to perform the first aid	if there’s any part falling down.

610
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,120
HE CAN FIX STUFF!!

611
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,400
Team A starts with a strong item as their base and continues piling up.

612
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,340
Vertically.

613
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,600
Up.

614
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,159
It can’t be put like that.

615
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,860
Team B starts by piling up their tables.

616
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,620
THEY’RE SO UNITED.
Team B starts by piling up their tables.

617
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,920
Team C comes with a special strategy.

618
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,400
They chose a packaging box to have it adhered to by tape.

619
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL AID!!
They chose a packaging box to have it adhered to by tape.

620
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
What s sharp-witted team.
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL AID!!

621
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,740
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL AID!!

622
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,840
Hey, it’s leaning.

623
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,639
Hang on.

624
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
PUT IT UP WELL!!
It works.

625
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,280
Team A is still working on it with great effort, continue stacking stronger items.

626
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,600
ALL ARE TABLES!!
Team B is busily choosing the table that can make the strongest base.

627
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,219
Team B is busily choosing the table that can make the strongest base.

628
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,700
Look at them.	Team C is extending their item the longest they can.

629
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,480
THEY ARE SO PATIENT!!
Look at them.	Team C is extending their item the longest they can.

630
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,960
THEY ARE SO PATIENT!!

631
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,140
In just a few seconds, theirs is now higher than other teams’.

632
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,860
Get it down.

633
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,660
The winner for this game is Team C!

634
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,920
SUPER HIGH!!
The winner for this game is Team C!

635
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,480
They chose useful items and planned so well.

636
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,760
Three points are awarded to this team!

637
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,680
Since they ran out of time before finishing,

638
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Team A earns 2 points!

639
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,920
Team B has tried their best with all items they own,

640
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,860
but they lose, earning only 1 point!

641
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,399
Now, our long competition in ‘Intro to Rangers’ has now come to an end!

642
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,380
The winning team, earning as many as 18 points, is Team C.

643
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,500
Off, New, Arm, Mond, and Earth.

644
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,460
A shoo-in is always a shoo-in.

645
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,720
Superb!

646
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,379
The team that almost beat Team C has won a total of 16 points.

647
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,280
They rank second today.

648
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,780
It’s Team A with Nicky, Leo, Gun, Nanon, and First.

649
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,460
They have done their best until the very last minute.

650
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,000
The losing team with only 10 points is Team B,

651
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,560
consisting of Tay, Sing, White, Chimon, and Mix.

652
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,620
The previous legend is yet to be told,

653
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,459
but another legend is about to start again.

654
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,800
How tough will the punishment be?

655
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Let’s find out in our final break.

656
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,980
There’s still one special mission waiting to push our rangers to their limits!

657
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,620
It’s high and could make their stomach drop!

658
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,679
You’re back with us in School Rangers: ‘Intro to Ranger’.

659
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,980
Though our competition has ended, and the losing team has been revealed,

660
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,380
before moving to the punishment time, we’ve prepared the last mission

661
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,300
to test these 15 rangers’ courage.

662
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,060
This mission is “Who’s Got the Guts?”

663
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:31,780
Now, it’s time for our special mission: “Who’s Got the Guts?”.

664
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,500
What’s special about this mission is that if you succeed,

665
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,940
you will receive a “Ranger Golden Card”.

666
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,360
Throughout 2022,

667
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,899
if you lose any game and have to be punished in any week of our show,

668
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,460
you can use this card to skip the punishment.

669
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,160
For this mission,

670
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,780
we ask for volunteers.

671
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:04,000
Each ranger must wear a safety outfit and climb a nearly 5-meter-tall pole,

672
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,020
equaling the height of a two-floor building.

673
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,520
When you reach the top,

674
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,720
you must muster up your courage and jump down.

675
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,060
Then, the mission is complete!

676
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,260
It’s super high and thrilling.

677
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,460
How many times can we do it?

678
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,820
One card for one jump.

679
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,159
But if you need more…

680
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,860
For example, in one year, I get punished around 30 times,

681
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,959
so I can jump 30 times.

682
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
You can’t.

683
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,220
I can’t, right?

684
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,540
We can only get one card each today.

685
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,920
Let me ask you guys now.

686
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
This is not a mandatory mission.

687
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,140
It’s voluntary.

688
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,620
Who wants to accept this challenge?

689
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,479
I do.

690
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,480
Quite a lot of you do.

691
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,760
First, Mix, White, Chimon, Tay, New, Earth, and Off are in.

692
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
A lot of you want to challenge yourself.

693
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,440
You’re in also, Nanon?

694
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,820
Alright.

695
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,939
If you all are ready, let’s jump.

696
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,100
Now, we’ve already got the rangers who volunteer to join this mission.

697
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,679
Nine of them are joining us.

698
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,560
Will each of them have enough courage to pass this mission?

699
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,340
Let’s root for them!

700
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,740
Challenge yourself for our first Golden Card in 2022!

701
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,379
Our first ranger is Off Jumpol.

702
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,380
I’m going.

703
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,160
Off comes with full confidence, being the first one to challenge his courage.

704
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,220
He’s calmly climbing up with a cool gesture.

705
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,580
SO COOL!
He’s calmly climbing up with a cool gesture.

706
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,020
SO COOL!

707
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,820
Off, you’re great!
SO COOL!

708
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,120
Off, you’re great!

709
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,159
He’s now standing cool on the top.

710
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,940
HE LOOKS SO RELAXED!!
He’s now standing cool on the top.

711
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,600
HE LOOKS SO RELAXED!!

712
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,600
What a cool jump!

713
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,919
His jump gives such a warm encouragement to the rest of the rangers.

714
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
How cool you are!

715
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,480
Why did it look so easy for him?

716
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,439
Go, Tay!

717
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,140
You can do it!

718
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,800
Tay is eagerly climbing.

719
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,300
HE’S SHAKING.
Tay is eagerly climbing.

720
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,439
Help me!

721
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,840
Your voice can shake, but your legs can’t.

722
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,399
The higher it gets, the more thrilling it becomes.

723
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,140
His legs are giving him trouble now.

724
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,540
HIS LEGS ARE NOT HELPING HIM.
His legs are giving him trouble now.

725
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:19,820
HIS LEGS ARE NOT HELPING HIM.

726
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,399
He’s reached the top, the most challenging spot.

727
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,640
LET ME HOLD ONTO IT!
It’s the highest step.

728
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,699
You need to go up.

729
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
We’re not sure if his heart is trembling inside,

730
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
but his body is obviously shaking.

731
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,100
KEEP CALM.

732
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,860
Go for it.

733
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,920
ALL ARE SO EXCITED FOR HIM!!!

734
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,520
He keeps standing there.

735
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
The longer you stay still, the more thrilling it becomes.

736
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,900
A CHEER-UP SONG!!

737
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,440
Tay used his scream to overcome his fear and successfully jumped!

738
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,060
Great job!

739
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,460
It’s New’s turn.

740
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,720
He’s climbing effortlessly.

741
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,860
Mr. Stoneman feels nothing, undoubtedly.

742
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,780
He keeps smiling from the bottom to the top.

743
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,340
There’s one more step.

744
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,379
You need to go up there.

745
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,880
Hang on.	Let me hold onto something.

746
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,460
All of us need to find something to hold onto.

747
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,980
But the last step is kind of thrilling.

748
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,139
A lively jump by New!

749
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,900
Look at him.

750
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,940
Let’s see how Earth is doing.

751
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,040
He climbs so smoothly.

752
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,040
IS THAT TOO FAST?
With this much strength, he can climb 10 more poles.

753
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,820
With this much strength, he can climb 10 more poles.

754
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,139
Earth is so fast.

755
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,820
He quickly reached the top.

756
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,980
SMILE!!

757
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,660
A wonderful jump by Earth.

758
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,659
HE’S TOO STRONG TO RESIST!!
A wonderful jump by Earth.

759
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,460
HE’S TOO STRONG TO RESIST!!

760
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,480
Mix is climbing slowly.

761
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,720
His legs get tired too soon.

762
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,980
He’s resting there for a while.

763
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,040
TAKE A BREAK!
He’s resting there for a while.

764
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,239
How lovely!
TAKE A BREAK!

765
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,100
I believe me.

766
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,819
I was there.

767
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,560
You can do it.

768
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,219
Believe me.

769
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,300
Hey, what’s that?

770
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,740
HE’S WARY OF EVERYTHING!!
Fight on, boy.
Hey, what’s that?

771
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,199
His face looks like a red panda.

772
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,100
How do we call it?
How do we call it?

773
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
I get stuck here.

774
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,420
Finally, Mix has mustered up his courage and reached the same challenging spot.

775
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,780
SLOW BUT SURE!
Finally, Mix has mustered up his courage and reached the same challenging spot.

776
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,560
Breathe.

777
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,040
DON’T FORGET TO BREATHE.

778
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,239
His heart says yes,

779
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,020
but his legs say ‘not yet’!What should he do?

780
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,740
Mix, it’s totally fine.	Believe me.

781
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,419
#SUPPOTER
His legs are dying already. He can’t move.

782
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
Slowly. Squat down first.

783
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,200
Can I jump already?

784
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,060
Nope!

785
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Smile for yourself first.	Smile.

786
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,319
HE CAN STILL SMILE!!

787
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,060
THIS FAMILIAR RHYTHM!!

788
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,660
His legs are really shaking.

789
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,819
Just imagine that you’re a giraffe.

790
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,040
You’re already tall.

791
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,680
Every step is testing his courage limit.

792
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,560
All rangers down there are rooting for him all the way up to the top.

793
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,920
MORE EXCITED!!

794
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,700
Help!

795
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,120
Just one more step to go!

796
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,420
GREAT JOB!!
Just one more step to go!

797
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,780
GREAT JOB!!

798
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,980
Sing again.

799
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,160
HIS FAVORITE!!

800
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,820
He has decided to jump!!!	His courage and his scream are heard all over the forest.

801
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,040
Good job, Mix.

802
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,420
First is fearfully climbing.

803
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,000
Fight on, First!

804
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,279
The only difficult part is when you need to stand up there.

805
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,500
HIS VOICE DOESN’T SOUND SMOOTH THOUGH!!

806
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,240
Hang on.

807
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,540
Hey, wait.

808
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,580
It’s…

809
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,319
It’s…
HE HAS GONE SPEECHLESS.

810
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,340
It’s what?

811
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,279
I know now why you got stuck here.

812
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,840
A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING
I know now why you got stuck here.

813
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,440
A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

814
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,240
I know it now.
A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

815
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,819
A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

816
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,580
Reaching the top, he starts to realize his friends’ feelings.

817
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,980
Well, moving is already difficult for him.

818
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,380
HE CAN’T MOVE!!!

819
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,799
Why can’t I lift my right leg up?

820
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,300
HE HAS GONE STIFF!!

821
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,780
That happened to Mix too.

822
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,960
Sit well.	Squat down

823
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Up straight.

824
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,580
GRADUALLY!!

825
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,540
First is still not giving up.

826
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,220
He has gradually reached the top.

827
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
What are you blowing?

828
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,540
Hold onto the tree again.

829
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,120
A POPULAR SPOT!!

830
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,920
But it can’t help us at all.

831
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,580
JUST HOLDING ONTO IT IS ENOUGH.

832
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,600
YOU’RE ALMOST THERE!!

833
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,740
You’re alright now after stepping on it.
Believe me.

834
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,740
Try looking down.

835
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,759
DON’T TEASE HIM.

836
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,680
No!!! I don’t want to look.

837
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,480
Rangers are cheering him on,but now, First is not listening to anyone.

838
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,200
Cheerleader, are you ready?

839
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,379
Wait!

840
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,220
Why is it so high?

841
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
HE CAN’T CONCENTRATE ANY LONGER!!
Come one.	A ready pose.

842
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,279
Raise your hands up.

843
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,040
Wait!

844
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,220
Is this level alright?

845
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,220
READY!!

846
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,500
Breathe in deeply.
Jump!

847
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,860
Jump.

848
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,920
I’m coming!!!

849
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,400
READY TO COME DOWN!!
I’m coming!!!

850
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,660
READY TO COME DOWN!!

851
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,860
I love you!

852
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,240
I love you too, bro.

853
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,799
Hey, wait.

854
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,520
HE’S NO LONGER READY!!

855
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,180
CONCENTRATE!!

856
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,180
THIS TIME IS FOR REAL!!

857
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,740
One, two, three!
THIS TIME IS FOR REAL!!

858
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,420
FLYING!!

859
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,280
He’s safely jumped down.
FLYING!!

860
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,560
He’s safely jumped down.

861
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,480
He has already exceeded his own limit!

862
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,740
Is it worth it?

863
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,280
Is it worth it?

864
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,460
How can this be difficult, huh?

865
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,660
REAL BALL OF FIRE HERE!!

866
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,359
Nanon is earnestly going up.

867
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,700
His first few steps went fine,

868
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,319
but it’s getting more thrilling.

869
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,140
Now, he understands how challenging it is to exceed his limit.

870
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,980
Alright.

871
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,740
I got it.

872
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,200
He gets stuck at the top of the pole.

873
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,480
He’s shaking.

874
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,300
IT’S HARD TO MOVE!!
His limbs are not cooperating.

875
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,420
His limbs are not cooperating.

876
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,780
It’s scary up here.

877
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,440
Fight on, boy.

878
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,900
Just one jump and it’s done.

879
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,740
Though he’s shaking, he is not giving up.

880
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,779
He has finally reached the top.

881
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,060
Let him rest his mind for a while.

882
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,400
GATHER HIS ENERGY!!

883
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,200
He finally jumped with a loud scream.

884
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,700
Such a good and loud voice he has.That’s why he deserves to be a singer.

885
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,540
That’s a successful self-conquest. Amazing!

886
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,080
White is relaxingly climbing up.

887
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,100
He has mustered up his courage well.

888
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,839
Great job.

889
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,700
but now he starts to be afraid.

890
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,720
That spot, right?

891
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,299
It is.

892
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,980
THE MOST CHALLENGING SPOT OF ALL!!
It is.

893
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,860
THE MOST CHALLENGING SPOT OF ALL!!

894
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,080
Each step requires so much courage.

895
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,000
He’s finally reached the top.

896
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,180
Since he has calmed himself down,his body is also ready.

897
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,279
Close your eyes and jump!

898
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,960
SETTING HIS SPIRIT FREE!!

899
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,260
White used his calmness to overcome his fear.

900
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,580
PRAYING!!

901
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,640
Chimon’s confidence is no joke.

902
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,140
He’s smoothly climbing up.

903
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,279
SO FAST!!
He’s smoothly climbing up.

904
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,500
SO FAST!!

905
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,860
He’s going up fast.

906
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,040
You’re amazing.

907
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,420
It’s not tough.

908
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,100
Why are you guys scared?

909
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,279
At first, he was speeding up,

910
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,280
but after looking down, now he’s stunned.See?

911
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,540
I’m convinced now.

912
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,920
REAL CHALLENGE UP THERE!!

913
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,720
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

914
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,240
Keep going.

915
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,120
But he’s not giving up yet.

916
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,680
He’s now trying to reach the final step.

917
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,700
Can I jump now?

918
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,100
Nope!
WITH THIS POSE?

919
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,280
I’ll give you 20 THB.

920
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,720
Nope!

921
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,660
Since you have come this far, don’t give up.

922
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,339
One more step to go!!

923
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,100
LAST ONE!!

924
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,860
Finally, he’s reached the top.

925
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,580
Shaking?	Where?

926
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,860
Even his arms are shaking.

927
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,380
JUMPING OFF!

928
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:41,880
Chimon finally jumped with all his courage.
JUMPING OFF!

929
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,080
Chimon finally jumped with all his courage.

930
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,360
Though his eyes are completed closed,

931
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,260
his heart is not giving up until the end.

932
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,420
Rangers who are awarded Golden Cards today include

933
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,720
Off, Tay, New, Earth, Mix, First, Nanon, White, and Chimon.

934
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,879
No matter how high and thrilling it is,

935
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,820
our rangers have already successfully challenged their own limits.

936
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,020
Each of them is awarded one Golden Card

937
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,980
which allows them to skip one punishment this year.

938
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,800
But!

939
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,560
This privilege can’t be used today!

940
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,399
Punishment is now waiting for our losing team in the next break.

941
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,640
Team B, how do you feel?

942
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,720
You guys lose today.

943
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,299
That’s predictable, isn’t it?

944
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,840
It’s your first time hosting with us,

945
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,040
and now you are about to be punished.

946
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,320
Ever since I’ve been in this show,

947
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,980
When you were our guest,	you didn’t win either?

948
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Today, you still didn’t win?

949
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,540
Exactly.

950
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,580
Is that the reason you’re here to become one of our rangers?

951
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,839
Because you’re sure you will win once?

952
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,660
That’s right.

953
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,060
THE VICTORY HE HAS BEEN DREAMING OF

954
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:42,640
Team B members are waiting for their punishment.	We’ll be back real soon!

955
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,700
Welcome back to the final break of ‘Intro to Rangers’.

956
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,080
Previously, they challenged themselves and received Golden Cards.

957
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,560
But our losing team, Team B, is still waiting for punishment.

958
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,160
Golden Cards can’t save them this time.

959
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,460
They will be punished!

960
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,640
Here we are.

961
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,420
It’s punishment time.

962
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,980
Today’s defeat is so bitter.

963
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,380
So, we must add some sweetness.

964
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,000
FULL OF INNER FEELINGS!!
So, we must add some sweetness.

965
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,540
FULL OF INNER FEELINGS!!

966
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,400
What are you looking at, White?

967
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,820
HE WILL BE DONE!!!

968
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,100
Leo, give them a signal.

969
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:38,080
Since we don’t want to make this year’s first punishment too bitter,

970
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,120
we are going to soak them with sweeten-flavored water.

971
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,160
We hope sweetness can help conquer your bitterness.

972
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,259
White, are you going to take revenge on me?

973
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,440
Dude, this is filled with my love.

974
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:50,940
WITH LOVE AND RED DRINK!!
Dude, this is filled with my love.

975
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,940
WITH LOVE AND RED DRINK!!

976
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,820
Tay doesn’t allow us to punish.

977
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,300
Be ready.

978
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,640
One, two, three!

979
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,080
Go!

980
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,040
Well, they’re no longer brothers for now, are they?

981
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,460
WHAT A REFRESHING SWEETNESS!!
Well, they’re no longer brothers for now, are they?

982
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,280
We have this horror movie scene here.

983
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
He is soaked.

984
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,640
White and Chimon are not in a pleasant condition now.

985
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,100
I HAD BETTER RUN!!

986
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,660
We also have an action movie scene around here.

987
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,799
Who wants to get soaked alone, huh?

988
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,120
Ready and go!!

989
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,960
It’s alright.

990
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,880
Well, how come there’s a romantic scene here?

991
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,760
That’s a gentle punishment.

992
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,760
What a sweet one, Mix.

993
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,820
Wash your face.

994
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,520
SHAKING TO DEATH!!

995
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Freezing!

996
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,900
Come on.	Losers must take care of themselves.

997
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,339
CLINGING SO TIGHTLY!

998
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,740
Hey, please give elephants those drinks.

999
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,680
He wants to get washed.

1000
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,080
I feel like I also get punished,

1001
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,500
THAT’S CALLED LOVE!!

1002
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,000
This is our perfect ending of School Rangers: ‘Intro to Rangers’.

1003
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,820
In addition to using different skills in competing,

1004
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:24,880
our rangers have also learned to accept both victory and failure.

1005
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,680
Fight on, our 15 rangers!

1006
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,220
Great, Best, Amazing!	Our rangers!

1007
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,620
It’s a wrap for School Rangers’ special episode, ‘Intro to Rangers.’

1008
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,840
After we got our basic skills adjusted,

1009
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
I want to ask our three new rangers.

1010
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,300
Which skill do you think you are good at?

1011
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,640
I think I’m agile, quick, and strong.

1012
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,360
Today, we tested our agility, strength,

1013
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
and courage to overcome our fear of height.

1014
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,720
These are the three skills I don’t own.

1015
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,399
GOT IT!!

1016
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:02,960
But if you test other skills, we will see.
GOT IT!!

1017
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,320
But if you test other skills, we will see.

1018
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,319
So, he’s just yielding for now,

1019
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,320
deceiving existing rangers.

1020
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,540
I think the skill that makes me stand out

1021
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,360
is the fact that I’m good at selecting teammates.

1022
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,680
A NEW SKILL HERE

1023
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,960
I can make a balance when choosing my team members.

1024
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,860
They mustn’t be too bold or too vulnerable either.

1025
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,859
Are you insulting me?

1026
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:23,980
Nope.

1027
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,840
What about your favorite mission?

1028
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,540
Mond?

1029
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,580
I enjoyed Rock Climbing.

1030
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,620
It was pretty fun.

1031
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,120
I like the first one.

1032
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
Hit the balloon.

1033
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,680
V ladder.

1034
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,500
I like that Golden Card mission.

1035
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,800
Same here.

1036
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,700
So much fun.

1037
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,200
I like archery.

1038
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,939
I want to shoot more.

1039
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,660
Well, I didn’t hit the target,

1040
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,859
so I won’t count it as my favorite.

1041
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,600
I like that mission that tested our balancing skill.

1042
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,120
Mine is that Golden Card mission.

1043
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,420
Mine is that Golden Card mission.

1044
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,420
Rock Climbing.

1045
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,460
That one (Golden Card).

1046
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,220
Nice.

1047
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,060
Same here.

1048
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Same here.

1049
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,920
It challenged our fear.

1050
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,620
I like the first one.
Same?

1051
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,960
V ladder?

1052
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,920
I like them all.

1053
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,340
I enjoy every moment spent with rangers.

1054
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,780
GETS EMOTIONAL!!

1055
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,299
It’s like you’re somehow leaving us?

1056
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,180
No way.

1057
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,000
Even if you kick me out, I won’t leave.

1058
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I like that balancing game.

1059
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,000
Why?

1060
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,700
Because we won?

1061
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,520
Exactly.

1062
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,000
I like that balancing game and archery.

1063
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,220
Alright.

1064
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,440
We have already got our skills adjusted.

1065
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,460
