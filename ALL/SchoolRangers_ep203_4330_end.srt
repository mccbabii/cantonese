968
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,100
Leo, give them a signal.

969
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:38,080
Since we don’t want to make this year’s first punishment too bitter,

970
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,120
we are going to soak them with sweeten-flavored water.

971
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,160
We hope sweetness can help conquer your bitterness.

972
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,259
White, are you going to take revenge on me?

973
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,440
Dude, this is filled with my love.

974
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:50,940
WITH LOVE AND RED DRINK!!
Dude, this is filled with my love.

975
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,940
WITH LOVE AND RED DRINK!!

976
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,820
Tay doesn’t allow us to punish.

977
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,300
Be ready.

978
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,640
One, two, three!

979
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,080
Go!

980
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,040
Well, they’re no longer brothers for now, are they?

981
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,460
WHAT A REFRESHING SWEETNESS!!
Well, they’re no longer brothers for now, are they?

982
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,280
We have this horror movie scene here.

983
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
He is soaked.

984
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,640
White and Chimon are not in a pleasant condition now.

985
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,100
I HAD BETTER RUN!!

986
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,660
We also have an action movie scene around here.

987
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,799
Who wants to get soaked alone, huh?

988
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,120
Ready and go!!

989
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,960
It’s alright.

990
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,880
Well, how come there’s a romantic scene here?

991
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,760
That’s a gentle punishment.

992
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,760
What a sweet one, Mix.

993
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,820
Wash your face.

994
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,520
SHAKING TO DEATH!!

995
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Freezing!

996
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,900
Come on.	Losers must take care of themselves.

997
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,339
CLINGING SO TIGHTLY!

998
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,740
Hey, please give elephants those drinks.

999
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,680
He wants to get washed.

1000
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,080
I feel like I also get punished,

1001
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,500
THAT’S CALLED LOVE!!

1002
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,000
This is our perfect ending of School Rangers: ‘Intro to Rangers’.

1003
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,820
In addition to using different skills in competing,

1004
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:24,880
our rangers have also learned to accept both victory and failure.

1005
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,680
Fight on, our 15 rangers!

1006
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,220
Great, Best, Amazing!	Our rangers!

1007
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,620
It’s a wrap for School Rangers’ special episode, ‘Intro to Rangers.’

1008
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,840
After we got our basic skills adjusted,

1009
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
I want to ask our three new rangers.

1010
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,300
Which skill do you think you are good at?

1011
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,640
I think I’m agile, quick, and strong.

1012
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,360
Today, we tested our agility, strength,

1013
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
and courage to overcome our fear of height.

1014
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,720
These are the three skills I don’t own.

1015
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,399
GOT IT!!

1016
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:02,960
But if you test other skills, we will see.
GOT IT!!

1017
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,320
But if you test other skills, we will see.

1018
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,319
So, he’s just yielding for now,

1019
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,320
deceiving existing rangers.

1020
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,540
I think the skill that makes me stand out

1021
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,360
is the fact that I’m good at selecting teammates.

1022
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,680
A NEW SKILL HERE

1023
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,960
I can make a balance when choosing my team members.

1024
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,860
They mustn’t be too bold or too vulnerable either.

1025
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,859
Are you insulting me?

1026
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:23,980
Nope.

1027
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,840
What about your favorite mission?

1028
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,540
Mond?

1029
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,580
I enjoyed Rock Climbing.

1030
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,620
It was pretty fun.

1031
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,120
I like the first one.

1032
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
Hit the balloon.

1033
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,680
V ladder.

1034
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,500
I like that Golden Card mission.

1035
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,800
Same here.

1036
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,700
So much fun.

1037
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,200
I like archery.

1038
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,939
I want to shoot more.

1039
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,660
Well, I didn’t hit the target,

1040
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,859
so I won’t count it as my favorite.

1041
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,600
I like that mission that tested our balancing skill.

1042
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,120
Mine is that Golden Card mission.

1043
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,420
Mine is that Golden Card mission.

1044
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,420
Rock Climbing.

1045
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,460
That one (Golden Card).

1046
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,220
Nice.

1047
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,060
Same here.

1048
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Same here.

1049
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,920
It challenged our fear.

1050
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,620
I like the first one.
Same?

1051
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,960
V ladder?

1052
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,920
I like them all.

1053
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,340
I enjoy every moment spent with rangers.

1054
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,780
GETS EMOTIONAL!!

1055
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,299
It’s like you’re somehow leaving us?

1056
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,180
No way.

1057
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,000
Even if you kick me out, I won’t leave.

1058
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I like that balancing game.

1059
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,000
Why?

1060
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,700
Because we won?

1061
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,520
Exactly.

1062
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,000
I like that balancing game and archery.

1063
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,220
Alright.

1064
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,440
We have already got our skills adjusted.

1065
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,460
All of us, 15 rangers, promise to do our best in any mission assigned.

1066
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,780
BE PREPARED FOR FUN!

1067
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,620
Please welcome our three new rangers.

1068
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,140
OUR TEAM IS GETTING BIGGER!!

1069
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,580
Thank you.

1070
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,600
It’s a wrap for this week,

1071
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:47,799
but throughout 2022, we have more fun and interesting missions awaiting.

1072
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,220
For today, we express our thanks to our shooting location,

1073
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,040
The Verona at Tub Lan!

1074
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,120
We would like to invite you to enjoy your trip here.

1075
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,480
The weather is amazing here, and they also offer you rooms to stay in.

1076
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,040
The bed is so comfy.

1077
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,060
It is perfectly a good choice for your family trip.

1078
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:10,680
You can bring every family member along to take photos here because we have what?

1079
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,560
We have a flower field here.

1080
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,759
For anyone who is an adventurous traveler,

1081
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,060
Also, those who enjoy taking photos couldn’t miss it either.

1082
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:24,259
The Verona at Tub Lan in Prachinburi is only a two-hour drive from Bangkok.

1083
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,380
Please make your visit.

1084
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,540
Thank you.

1085
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,120
Our time is up for today.

1086
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,100
We’ll see you again every Saturday at 11 AM on GMM25.

1087
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,180
It’s time for us, 15 rangers of 2022, to say goodbye.

1088
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,180
Bye!

1089
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
SORRY. HE’S NEW HERE.

1090
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,920
Next week, meet our guests, Nanon, Khao Tung, Kay, PiPloy, and View

1091
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,840
from 55:15 Never Too Late series.

1092
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:11,100
They will walk on a coconut shell, play soccer and jump as high as possible.

1093
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,339
How will their skills be?

1094
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:20,400
Find out next Saturday at 11 AM on GMM25.
