First：估唔到

926
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,160
Nicky：好勁

927

Tay：好快

928
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,920
Mix：我對腳仲震緊

929
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,720
Gun：佢對腳震緊因為佢怕高

930
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,240
【佢對腳好唔合作】
Gun：佢對腳震緊因為佢怕高

931

Leo：我哋大鑊喇

932
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,800
Nicky：唔緊要，First，冇事嘅

933
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,880

Mix：好得人驚，好高

936
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,920
啲板會搖

937
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,300
我要平衡到先

938
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,540
一個唔小心就會跌咗落嚟

939
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,960
【佢仲好攰】

940
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,960

我好驚

942
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,279
我行得好快因為 P’ Boy 話如果我贏咗會額外有錢

943
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,020
【佢為咗奬金好努力】

944
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,660
Tay：佢最勁係佢嗌出嚟等自己冇咁驚

945
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,660
佢由第一下到最後一下都嗌得好好

946
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,520
如果佢跌咗落嚟我哋會跑開

947
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,420
佢跌落地之後我會跑番嚟幫佢

948

呢嗰係我隱藏嘅能力嚟

1020
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,419
我覺得我玩遊戲發掘到潛能幾好

1021
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,820

1025
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,799
玩緊嗰陣覺得好驚

1026
不過爬落嚟嗰陣仲驚

1027
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,800
Leo：First 觀察得 Mix 好好

1028
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,960
Mix 好慢同好耐先完成

1029
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,460
以我嘅觀察 First 快啲

1030
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,480
Gun：佢可能快過我𠻹

1031
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
Nicky：原本我以為你會慢過 Mix

1032
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,640
但你開始嗰陣，你有你嘅節奏同冇乜點錯

1033

Earth：睇咗

1038
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,720
Off：佢哋你業餘嘅

1039

Earth：多謝

1048
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,080
He didn’t know it was our plan.

1049
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,259
But he gains strength from it.

1050
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,960
Then our plan went wrong.

1051
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,840
Will Tay’s plan to falsely praise Earth work?

1052
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,840
Let’s see.

1053
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,440
Go. Keep going.

1054
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,520
The game is over.

1055
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,120
SUPER FAST.

1056
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,580
ARE YOU IN A RUSH?

1057
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,960
Tay’s plan doesn’t work with Earth.

1058
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,760
He is unstoppable and as fast as lightning.

1059
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,620
HE DOESN’T MAKE A SINGLE MISTAKE.

1060
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,180
SUPER SCARY.

1061
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,759
He’s very fast.

1062
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,520
HE’S THE REAL DEAL.

1063
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,720
Take it easy, Earth.

1064
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,700
WHY IS HE SO FAST?

1065
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,920
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

1066
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,920
THE PLAN FAILS.

1067
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,900
HE IS SO CHILL.

1068
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,720
Earth is going forwards at a fast speed.

1069
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,600
He’s not afraid nor stoppable.

1070
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,000
He’s too strong.

1071
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,320
THEY FEEL RELAXED NOW.
He’s too strong.

1072
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,180
Pierce it. Left and right.

1073
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,160
HE’S NOT SLOWING DOWN AT ALL.

1074
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,480
EARTH IS COMING.

1075
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,840
AMAZING.

1076
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,460
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

1077
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,660
SO PROUD.

1078
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,279
Your plan to cheer for him.

1079
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,640
The plan went wrong.

1080
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
Let’s get him some support so he would be overconfident.

1081
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,900
But he did so well.

1082
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,720
THANK YOU, BUDDY.

1083
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,720
Did you see it?

1084
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
It’s like we already won since the first round.

1085
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,620
I’m not here to lose. I’m here to win.

1086
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,080
I’M SERIOUS.
I’m not here to lose. I’m here to win.

1087
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,720
I’M SERIOUS.

1088
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,600
You kept stepping forward nonstop.

1089
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,259
Yes, but deep down, I was nervous.

1090
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,200
But I only thought I had to do it faster than the other two teams.

1091
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,779
Were your scared/

1092
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,740
I’m not afraid of height.

1093
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,680
First was wrong. This time I won’t take it easy on him.

1094
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,259
I’M HERE TO WIN.
First was wrong. This time I won’t take it easy on him.

1095
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,280
Let’s give Earth round applause.
First was wrong. This time I won’t take it easy on him.

1096
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,560
Let’s give Earth round applause.

1097
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,080
THE PRIDE OF THE TEAM.
Let’s give Earth round applause.

1098
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,520
THE PRIDE OF THE TEAM.

1099
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,200
How was I?

1100
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,080
You were very fast. I thought you were the god of thunder.

1101
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,940
He made me unexpectedly proud.

1102
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,759
I thought he would be hasty.

1103
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,480
But he wasn’t at all.

1104
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
There is a jealous team next to us.

1105
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,400
DON’T SHOW IT.

1106
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:56,900
Where?

1107
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,540
This is easy.

1108
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,060
The next round will be easy too.

1109
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,080
Yes, if Sing starts the game.

1110
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,240
But I’m worried about Gun.

1111
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,660
Gun will be fast.

1112
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,560
Don’t say you are worried. Say you are afraid.

1113
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,720
IS IT THAT BAD?

1114
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,120
When it comes to speed, he is no.1.

1115
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,260
This fun in this week is over.

1116
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,520
But don’t be so quick to judge.

1117
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,020
It’s not certain who will win the game.

1118
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,600
The first round allows the three new

1119
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,420
rangers – First, Earth, and Mix to show their potential.

1120
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,720
They all have fighting spirits.

1121
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,120
They will be able to compete with the veteran rangers just fine.

1122
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,819
How will the result of this game turn out? Check it out next week.

1123
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Thank you, the Verona at Tab Lan in Prachinburi, for the filming location.

1124
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,080
It’s close to Bangkok, with only 2-3 hours of driving.

1125
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,680
The air is fresh and the accommodations are comfortable.

1126
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,980
It’s a great place for a family vacation.

1127
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:06,000
If you are an adventure lover, there are many obstacles for you to enjoy.

1128
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,060
There’s also a flower garden for photo shooting.

1129
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,800
Thank you.

1130
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,340
The players in the second round are also as good as those in the first round.

1131
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,580
Who will win the first game?

1132
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,460
Find out in the next episode, airing next Saturday at noon.
