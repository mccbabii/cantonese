1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,760
This programme was filmed under strict COVID-19 preventive measures.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:14,040
All the cast and crew members are vaccinated, and were tested with ATK before filming.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,880
The filming began after everyone was tested negative.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,659
That’s enough.

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,980
Hello!

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,440
Get to meet us every Saturday at 11 o’clock in this fun show…

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,879
School Rangers!

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:55,040
We welcome the new year with this new atmosphere, and more importantly.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,120
See this?

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,820
A new uniform.

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,140
What do you guys think of the concept of this new uniform?

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,440
Higher-quality material.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,880
Higher-quality material?

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,679
I think it’s more fashionable!

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
It looks extra.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,340
We’re going into this new year with the bright red colour.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,880
Red means we’re full of energy to bring happiness and entertainment to the fans.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,420
WELL SAID

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,800
The uniform may be new. But we’ve still got all the rangers here, haven’t we?

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
ALL RANGERS PRESENT

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,280
We’re all here and we’ve got the same love and tenderness for each other, per usual.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,419
Never have we ever thought of harming each other, again, per usual.

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,340
We’ve seen many of our rangers grow from when they first joined us.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,380
Chimon, for example, joined the rangers when he was, what, 18-19?

25
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,619
Many of you have upped your skills.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,420
You weren’t so eloquent before but now y’all talk loads.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,480
Like P’White, who was shy and calm, is now hilarious.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
P’White is now rough and brave.

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,279
P’White is now full of jokes.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,740
That’s enough.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,240
NO NEED FOR FLATTERY

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,080
When we started out, P’Arm always won every game like the perfect man that he was.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,160
But lately? Not so much.

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,579
ARM HAS LEO’S HEAD MARKED
We’ll see about that.

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,800
Has time been cruel to you, P’Arm?

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,060
Let’s not talk about that.

37
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,680
If we’re talking about development, mine lies in my ability to host live events.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I used to go with P’Leo and Godji, right?

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,060
Now they only need me and Godji. P’Leo isn’t necessary.

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,520
HARSH!

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,120
Someone with your demeanour needs to take an intensive course.

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,500
This is in order for you to become a proper ranger.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,060
So I’ve got a special course just for you, Leo!

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,900
But really, when it comes to fighting spirit, I’m proud of everyone here.

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,100
Now, whichever show our rangers join, they always fight to the death.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,180
Everyone here is much stronger.

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,960
EVOLUTION

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,780
To conclude, we have evolved so much over 200 episodes.

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,440
And our love for each other has also grown.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,820
But today, we’ll be joined by three more rangers.

51
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,780
NEW FRIENDS

52
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,000
We’ve got 12 rangers right now, but three more are joining?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,380
Not one member left, and three more are joining!

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,280
THIS GETS REALLY COSY

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,840
Please welcome the first new ranger, Earth Pirapat!

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,360
Get on, everyone!

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,900
HE GIVES IT HIS ALL

58
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,579
Y’all made me do that first thing in the show?

59
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,320
Aren’t ya fit for your first episode?

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,320
Leave it to me to go big.

61
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,739
Are you really going to park it right here?

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,940
Earth made such a cool entrance.

63
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,820
But the next guy will make an elegant entrance.

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,959
WHO?

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,280
Please welcome Mix Sahaphap!

66
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,660
Hi there, Mix.

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,399
Not that. He’s over here!

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,940
Hello.

69
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,780
He did make an elegant entrance.

70
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,380
He’s literally promoting his hometown.

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,440
Welcome to my team.

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,620
But we’ve still got one more. Who’s the next guy, Tay Tawan?

73
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,280
These two made such cool entrances, but they don’t measure up to the last guy.

74
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,820
EXPECT A GRAND ENTRANCE

75
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,900
Please welcome First Kanaphan!

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,780
WHERE IS HE COMING FROM?

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,620
Is he entering from up above?

78
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Where is he?

79
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,320
He’s coming!

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,480
HE’S HERE

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,380
I’m here!

82
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,740
How the hell does this thing even work!

83
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,140
First Kanaphan!

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,140
Hello.

85
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,220
They asked you to ride that from over there?

86
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,760
Yeah.

87
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
But you just carried it.

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,840
It’s hard to ride.

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
You turned the wheel the wrong way.

90
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,580
Then how should I do it?

91
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,580
This side turns forward, not the other way around.

92
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,640
Go back and start over.

93
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,000
I’m begging you.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,660
I was waiting so long to make an entrance.

95
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,800
It’s for entertainment.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,540
Just do as your seniors ask, man!

97
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:17,960
Yes, sir!

98
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,960
OBEDIENT

99
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,440
Too far, man.

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
Now that’s the correct way.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,620
Steer harder.

102
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,539
AS REQUESTED

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,600
That was the ranger spirit!

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,219
So we’ve got three more friends this year.

105
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,400
Earth Pirapat, Mix Sahaphap, and First Kanaphan.

106
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,640
The three upcoming stars are full of all-rounded potentials.

107
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,920
First was formerly a school idol, but now he’s an upbeat school ranger.

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,640
Earth has devoted his life to school rangers.

109
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,840
With his titan build, he’s been asked to go on various missions for school rangers.

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,599
The energetic guest star has now joined the show as a formidable ranger.

111
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,520
Lastly, Mix, the guest star who may not win the game, but win fans’ hearts.

112
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
Now he’s ready to win the hearts of people as the new ranger.

113
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,040
To perfectly welcome the new year, not only do we have three new members,

114
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,780
we have also upgraded our uniforms, too!

115
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:42,080
With new rangers and new uniforms, the new episodes will be even more fun.

116
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,840
Stay tuned to School Rangers 2022!

117
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,700
Since the new members are here for the first time as rangers, let them officially introduce themselves.

118
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,239
Hello. I’m Earth, your new ranger!

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,580
Hi there!

120
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,060
I’m First Kanaphan Puitrakul, also a new ranger. I’ll be in your care!

121
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,080
Hello. I’m Mix Sahaphap, the newest ranger.

122
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,260
These three have appeared in our show as guests.

123
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,219
But now that they’re here as rangers, do you guys know what qualifications must rangers have?

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,980
Strength and speed.

125
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,360
I think the key attribute of a school ranger host, which is most important…

126
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,880
is looks.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
GOOD ONE

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,380
Not only looks, but also skills.

129
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,040
The ability to compete.

130
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,380
The strength.

131
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,159
The brain.

132
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,040
These are the things I… don’t have.

133
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,660
But I hope this show will help me fulfil them.

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,719
Slowly learning to get better.

135
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,460
Like what my friend said, we need looks.

136
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,159
Don’t believe everything you hear.

137
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,740
Go on.

138
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Well, I don’t have any of those, either.

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,460
The skills, like First said, I’ll get from this show.

140
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,380
As seniors, we’ll give you newbies an orientation.

141
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,600
We have actually done a workshop to get familiar with each other.

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,599
If you’d like to know how chaotic that workshop was, take a look.

143
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,580
How did the orientation of the new rangers go?

144
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,840
Let’s see after a short commercial break.

145
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,460
Sponsored by Doi Kham’s tomato products.

146
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,680
We’re back with School Rangers: Intro to Rangers!

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,579
With new members joining,

148
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:35,600
we have a prep battle for the rangers to practice and get familiar with each other.

149
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Form a circle, please.

150
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,180
Form a circle.

151
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,400
ORIENTATION

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,100
LET’S GO

153
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,360
Spread the circle out, guys.

154
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,800
GREEN NITIWAT TANTIPATSIRI
Green		We’ll be playing this game called Hu-Ha-Hi. Say it, Hu-Ha-Hi!

155
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,859
Hu-Ha-Hi.

156
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,560
Hu-Ha-Hi!

157
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
This game will heighten your senses.

158
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,199
A good MC needs their senses. Repeat after me. Eyes on.

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,720
Eyes on!

160
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,760
You need your eyes always open.

161
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,900
Ears on.

162
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,140
Ears on!

163
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,860
Good job, children.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,260
Sound on.

165
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,760
Sound on!

166
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
Body on.

167
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Body on!

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,760
Lastly, mind on. Your mind needs to be alert.

169
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Alright? Put your hands into a gun.

170
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,200
WELL ARMED

171
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,439
This is what we’re gonna do.

172
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,700
One of us will say “Hu” and shoot upward. Say it with me. Hu!

173
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,200
Hu!

174
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,540
Shoot your gun upward. Hu!

175
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,459
Hu!

176
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,040
Only one person at a time. For example, if I go “Hu!”

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,880
The guys next to me need to turn their awareness on.

178
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,240
Keep yourself aware. If one person goes “Hu”, the guys next to them go “Ha” with a swing.

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,980
Let’s try in 1, 2, 3, Hu!

180
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,520
THERE THEY GO

181
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Then you can look for your next target.

182
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,520
If I shoot at Sing.

183
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:55,920
Hu!

184
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
The two right next to him go “Ha!”

185
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,959
Now Sing shoots at the next target.

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,180
Keep your eye contact game strong.

187
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,839
You guys are MCs of the same show, you need to be clear who you’re looking at.

188
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
If you’re slow, they’ll all know.

189
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,459
We’ll eliminate those who make mistakes one by one until there’s only one man left.

190
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,540
What a fun game this is. Applaud!

191
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,140
Spread the circle out far and wide, guys.

192
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,420
START!
Hu!

193
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
Ha!

194
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,540
Hi!

195
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,199
Hu!

196
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,720
Ha!

197
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,260
Hi!

198
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,860
Hu!

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,500
Ha!

200
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,439
Hi!

201
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,040
Hu!

202
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,760
Ha!

203
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,140
Hi!

204
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,939
SLOWLY

205
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,260
Hi!

206
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,880
Hu!

207
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,520
Ha!

208
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,099
Hi!

209
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,740
Hu!
FOCUS

210
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,240
Ha!

211
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,660
Hi!

212
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:34,980
Hu!

213
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,420
Ha!

214
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:35,740
Hi!

215
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,560
Hu!

216
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,140
Ha!

217
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,880
Hi!

218
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,340
Hu!

219
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,980
Ha!

220
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,640
Hi!

221
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,260
Hu!

222
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,819
Ha!

223
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
WHITE OUT!

224
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
You lost!

225
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,540
The first one to be eliminated is White.

226
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,860
It’s alright.

227
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,060
Wait on the sideline, White.

228
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
Go away, man.

229
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,859
DON’T FIGHT, GUYS
You’re so mean, P’Nicky.

230
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,079
Hu!

231
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,540
Ha!

232
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,000
Hi!

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Hu!

234
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,920
Ha!

235
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,339
Hi!

236
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,000
Hu!

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,280
Ha!

238
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Wait, what?

239
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
That’s “Ha”, you need to go “Hi”.

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,660
Ha!

241
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,079
Hi!

242
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,540
Hu!

243
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,939
Ha!

244
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,440
Hi!

245
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,100
Hu!

246
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,560
Ha!

247
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,300
Hi!

248
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,000
Hu!

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,440
Ha!

250
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,080
Hi!

251
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,660
Hu!

252
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,040
Ha!

253
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,540
Hi!

254
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,959
Hu!

255
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,420
Ha!

256
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:16,860
Hi!

257
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,300
Hu!

258
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,839
Ha!

259
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,300
Hi!

260
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,000
Hu!

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Ha!

262
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,939
Oh, dang! Nicky was a little overexcited that he popped his pants so wide.

263
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,420
And these are Dior!

264
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,940
They’re not used to strenuous work, huh?

265
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,660
I’m so bummed.

266
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,640
That was a good joke, though unintentional, please give Nicky a hand!

267
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,079
POOR GUY

268
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,800
ELIMINATED ONE BY ONE

269
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,740
MOND DID NOT MAKE IT

270
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,200
Be focused, guys.

271
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,000
Hu!

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,740
Ha!

273
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,300
Hi!

274
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,780
Hu!

275
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,120
Ha!

276
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,460
Hi!

277
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:56,920
Hahu!

278
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,599
Oh, Gun.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
BY A SYLLABLE

280
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,520
There they are, eliminated one by one.

281
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,420
This game really requires total concentration and wits.

282
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,959
The perfect way to train the rangers.

283
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,079
ELIMINATED

284
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,540
Aren’t they both new members?

285
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,240
Yes.

286
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,640
Stand back to back.

287
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,740
We’ll give them a topic.

288
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,760
For example, which animals are land animals.

289
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,200
If it is a land animal, the two guys here take a step forward.

290
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,640
You guys will be the ones coming up with ideas, like a horse.

291
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,180
Since horse is a land animal, these two take a step. A cow. That’s another step.

292
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,800
But if someone says an aquatic animal or any non-land animal.

293
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,579
What they need to do is to turn around and shoot the other guy.

294
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,140
Whoever shoots first wins.

295
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,180
You guys come up with a topic.

296
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,400
Let’s do provinces. Should be easy enough.

297
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,600
So the deciding moment is when it’s not a province in Thailand.

298
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,960
Get ready. Close your eyes, you two.

299
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,100
If you have an idea, raise your hand and I’ll point at you.

300
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,860
Bangkok.

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,280
CORRECT

302
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,500
Saraburi.

303
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,939
Prachinburi.

304
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,099
Is that a province?

305
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,540
Pattaya.
HESITATING

306
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,560
Pattaya isn’t a province.

307
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,859
Let’s think they’re even.
MIX IS CONFUSED

308
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,140
Khon Kaen.

309
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,540
Who else?

310
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,680
Chonburi.

311
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,939
Hatyai.

312
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,860
Bang!

313
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,740
And the winner is First!

314
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,219
HE’S GOOD
Hatyai isn’t a province, guys.

315
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
They shouldn’t have come this far.

316
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,240
It’s a district.

317
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,240
This should have ended with Pattaya.

318
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,319
Give the winner a round of applause.

319
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,300
THANK YOU

320
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:50,340
They really do try their best to learn about and bond with the new members.

321
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,180
Although Off and Gun must leave for work before this is over, the orientation goes on.

322
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,699
Let’s see what other skill set they’re acquiring.

323
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,120
This team is the red team and this is the blue.

324
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,480
You’ll be given a rough script and have two minutes to prepare.

325
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,840
Let’s begin.

326
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,220
You’re free to rehearse right now.

327
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,140
Now it is time for them to design their own style as MCs.

328
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,720
Both teams are so determined.

329
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,680
Try not to be reading the lines.

330
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,940
Feel free to add more to the story, but make sure you get the ideas across.

331
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,880
Please welcome the first team.

332
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,020
This way, gentlemen.

333
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,160
You guys who are watching, try not to laugh at their jokes.

334
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,819
PATIENT

335
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,340
You have five minutes.

336
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,740
Ready? In 5, 4, 3, 2…

337
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,439
Hello!

338
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,560
Oi, that’s the wrong way!

339
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,000
THEY AIM FOR LAUGHTERS
Oi, that’s the wrong way!

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Somebody's already laughing.

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,180
CAN’T HOLD BACK

342
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:06,240
This week on School Rangers, the rangers are visiting Khao Kheow Open Zoo!

343
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,540
FULL OF ENERGY

344
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,160
Why Open Zoo Khao Kheow?

345
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,620
Well, how would you get in if they’re a “Close” Zoo?

346
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,640
MORE JOKES

347
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,060
We’re here to see various animals.

348
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,579
Such as a hippo.

349
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Moo!

350
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,320
ARE YOU SURE?

351
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,020
A giraffe!

352
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
A snake!

353
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,300
A monkey!

354
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,199
A fox!

355
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,460
We’re also here to admire the good work of the students around here

356
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,380
with this “Finish the Proverb” game.

357
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,780
Are you guys familiar with proverbs?

358
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,380
Yes.

359
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,620
Really?
LET’S TEST

360
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,620
Make hay while…?

361
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,460
While the sun shines.

362
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,140
And if the sun doesn’t shine?

363
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,960
Don’t make any hay.

364
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,900
WHAT PROVERB IS THIS

365
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,480
You’ve got a problem with my jokes?

366
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,740
These are high quality jokes.

367
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,180
GOOD JOB

368
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,939
This team is led by Big Brother Nicky so it’s guaranteed to be funny.

369
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,140
They sure get a lot of laughter from the other team.

370
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,520
Now let’s see what Big Brother Leo’s team got up their sleeves.

371
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,520
Ready? Go!

372
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,100
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, Hey!

373
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:19,940
If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands!

374
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,480
You’ve successfully wasted one minute.

375
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,319
HE KNOWS

376
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,300
Hello!

377
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,660
School Rangers this weekday.

378
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
Weekend!

379
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,020
This weekend is very special.

380
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,620
How special is that?

381
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,820
Very very special.

382
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,500
Because the rangers are on a field trip today.

383
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,139
We came up with the same joke as them but we’re allowed to just tell it again.

384
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,820
The animals are king kong!

385
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,899
GO BIG

386
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,900
A woodpecker!

387
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,980
GO BIGGER

388
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,760
A bull!

389
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,639
HE FORGOT
What did we assign you as again?

390
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,320
HE FORGOT

391
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
A tiger.
HE FORGOT

392
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,580
NO HOLDING BACK

393
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,700
What about you?

394
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,580
Me?

395
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,480
I’m a polar bear.

396
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,240
Lots of animals.

397
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Not only will we meet these animals, but we’re admiring the good work of the students from around here.

398
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,600
To play our game, the players must imitate animals to complete the mission.

399
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,919
WELL DELIVERED

400
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,620
Stay tuned to the special episode of School Rangers: Zoo Rangers!

401
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
Okay!

402
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,500
Alright, alright! Both teams are doing well in the prep battle.

403
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:57,419
The workshop went well without a hitch. But how will they do in the real battleground?

404
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,360
Come back in the next break!

405
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,440
Time to officially welcome the three new members to the bunch.

406
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,840
What they did in the workshop is merely child play.

407
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,560
The real deal is waiting up ahead.

408
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,340
But for now, it is time to pick their team members!

409
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,940
Feel free to boast your skill sets, boys!

410
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,540
Alright, we’re now done with our workshop.

411
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,240
But what we need as a ranger is, first, wit.

412
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,580
Second, strength.

413
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,360
Third, we need teamwork.

414
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,180
And fourth, versatility.

415
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,680
So besides the workshop, we will be working on these skills

416
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,840
to get the new members more familiar with them.

417
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:02,360
Then we should ask the new rangers.

418
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
Versatile, witty, and good at teamwork.

419
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,740
I’ve got it all.

420
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,660
So cool.

421
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,740
It’s my first episode, after all.

422
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,379
I have to boast a little.

423
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
What about you, P’Mix?

424
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,500
Me? I think I’m very nimble.

425
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,600
You tripped over yourself just this morning, dude.

426
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,120
TOO NIMBLE, PERHAPS

427
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,719
I think what stands out about me is my wit.

428
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,320
I don’t have the strength to go against the muscly guys, honestly.

429
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,240
But I don’t know if I can have good teamwork with y’all, though, since this is my first episode.

430
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,240
We’ll have to wait and see about that.

431
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Wait, wait. What’s with the serious outlook?

432
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,040
Gotta boast a little.

433
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,700
Just remember what you guys said today.

434
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,520
When you reach a hundred episodes, it won’t be like this.

435
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
WORDS OF ADVICE

436
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,879
Of course, what’s really fun about School Rangers isn’t only the games,

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,800
but also the spirit to fight to the death of us rangers.

438
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,400
Because our penalties are really brutal.

439
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,800
I get it.

440
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,220
You do?

441
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,560
I get the penalty every time I come here.

442
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,460
And what’s really gonna save you from the possibility of these penalties is none other than having a strong team.

443
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,900
IMPORTANT

444
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,400
So we’re going to get into teams today.

445
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,820
We’ve got 15 rangers right now.

446
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,899
That means the rangers will be divided into three teams with five people each.

447
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,380
As a welcome gift to the rookies, they’ll be the ones choosing the members.

448
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,180
INTERESTING

449
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,520
We will decide who chooses first at random.

450
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,699
You will pick your team members one by one.

451
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,360
Who do you guys want, or not want, in your team and why?

452
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,360
I’m not very careful.

453
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,560
I’m the type to recklessly blast my way through.

454
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,800
So you’re gonna choose me?

455
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
THE VERY CAUTIOUS TAY

456
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,879
Who’re you gonna choose? Arm?

457
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,440
THE RIGHT GUY

458
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,540
P’Arm is very analytical and careful.

459
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,540
ANALYTICAL AND CAREFUL

460
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,120
So that’s why.

461
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,879
Then who is it that you absolutely don’t want on your team?

462
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,800
That’s hard.

463
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,540
Let’s move on to Mix.

464
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,860
TRIES TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT

465
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,800
I don’t want him to say it’s me he doesn’t want.

466
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,260
Who is it that you don’t want?

467
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,340
I can’t answer that.

468
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,540
No need to feel intimidated. We’re brothers.

469
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,020
Who is it?

470
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,180
Don’t freaking look at me.
DON’T PICK HIM

471
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,700
Who is it?

472
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,980
AVOIDING EYE CONTACT

473
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,380
Mr Tay Tawan is avoiding all eye contact right now.

474
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,080
NOT SO LOUD, MOND

475
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,980
No, he’s like my brother, so I’m okay with him.

476
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
PHEW!

477
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Relieved, aren’t you?

478
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,460
Just say it, Earth. There are no hard feelings after this.

479
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,480
It’s probably Mond.

480
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,800
He and I are both brawny so we’re bound to become careless.

481
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,639
I don’t want our recklessness off the chart.
REASONABLE

482
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,600
I don’t want our recklessness off the chart.

483
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,179
THEY’RE BOTH ENERGETIC

484
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,440
Too powerful, right?

485
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,880
What about you, Mix?

486
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,740
Actually, there are two guys I want on my team.

487
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,100
First is P’Arm.

488
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,760
Another is P’Gun.

489
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,980
And you called me your freaking idol, traitor.

490
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,020
UH-OH!

491
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,000
You really are my idol!

492
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,560
SOMEONE IS HOLDING A GRUDGE

493
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,940
P’Arm is sensible.

494
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,360
Like P’Earth said, he could be keeping us on the ground since he’s careful.

495
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,540
I’ve played with P’Gun before.

496
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,540
He’s got leadership.

497
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,920
With him on the team, we’re definitely gonna win.

498
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,980
And who is a no-no? Who is it that you can’t have on your team?

499
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,199
P’Tay.

500
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,260
AS EXPECTED

501
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,780
He didn’t even have to think about it.
AS EXPECTED

502
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,660
He didn’t even have to think about it.

503
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,060
He meant every word.

504
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,540
No, P’Tay and I are too alike.

505
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,860
Two of the same sort can’t be on the same ship.

506
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,700
We’re bound to wreck.

507
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,880
What sort are we?

508
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,520
The clumsy sort.
THEY’RE BOTH CLUMSY

509
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,860
What about you, First? Who do you want on your team?

510
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,139
I’ve got two on my mind.

511
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,380
P’Nicky and P’Leo.

512
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,260
THE BIG BROTHERS

513
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,060
I want someone sluggish to keep me in check.

514
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,919
I’m moving too fast.

515
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,940
Someone what again?

516
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,540
Sluggish and compliant.

517
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,659
If you don’t pick any of us as your first teammate, man.

518
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,520
Sure. I want someone sluggish and compliant to keep me in check.

519
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,139
Did you say compliant?

520
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,120
I did, compliant.

521
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,159
I get the sluggish part, but complaint sounds a little unusual.

522
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,980
So you want someone to slow you down.

523
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,120
He wants a veteran.

524
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,240
And who is it that you don’t want?

525
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,580
I don’t want P’Tay.

526
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
Why?

527
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,620
Because he and I are both chatty.

528
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,280
You’re afraid he’ll out-chat you.

529
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,660
You’re on the same wavelength.

530
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,020
We’re on the same wavelength.

531
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,440
HOW MEAN OF YOU, BROTHER

532
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,320
Alright, now we know who they want and who they don’t want.

533
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,820
The most popular choice is Arm.

534
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,580
And the least popular choice is Tay.

535
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,720
MEANIE

536
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,960
May luck be with you, rookies, because it’s time to choose. Let’s begin.

537
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,000
Ones-and-twos

538
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,040
The first one.

539
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,740
MIX IS THE FIRST ONE OUT.

540
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,660
He will be the last one to pick.

541
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,980
BUMMER!
Rock, paper, scissors.

542
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,120
Earth will be the first one to pick the members,

543
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,500
followed by First and Mix is the last one.

544
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,680
The first member that you want to join your team.

545
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,040
Earlier, you said that you want Arm.

546
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,500
Yes.

547
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Now you get the chance to choose. Will you pick Arm?

548
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,380
Your first member.Who will you choose, Earth?

549
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,480
I’ll pick my brother.

550
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,800
Me?

551
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,560
What about Arm?

552
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,040
Next round.

553
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,000
I’m nervous.

554
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,760
Why?

555
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,460
I never thought he would pick me because he didn’t choose me earlier.

556
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,200
Right?

557
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,040
He also talked about your bad bone.

558
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,360
Yes.

559
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,139
I’m kind-hearted. I think Off…

560
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,600
No one will pick me.

561
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,139
Yes.
HE LOVES HIS BROTHER.

562
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,460
Thank you.

563
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,780
You chose him out of pity.

564
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,680
You are kind-hearted.

565
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,140
Okay, next person.

566
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,600
First.

567
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,660
Who will you choose?

568
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,160
P’ Leo

569
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,240
Do I have any other choice?
FEEL SO PRESSURED!

570
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,960
TRY TO BE COMPOSED.

571
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,480
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

572
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,460
I choose P’ Gun.

573
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,899
Why did you take him away from me?

574
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,280
SAME CHOICE.

575
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,280
Because Gun has what I don’t have.

576
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,260
What is it?

577
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,100
He’s not afraid of height.

578
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,260
HE KNOWS THAT TOO.

579
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,140
I’m afraid of height.

580
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,240
FILL IN HIS WEAK POINT.

581
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,620
Mix, who will you choose?

582
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,540
Tay?

583
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,540
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
He doesn’t even look this way.

584
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,959
PLEASE LOOK THIS WAY.

585
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,460
Like you’ve said, this side is not even in his sight.

586
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,620
Do you know that Sing is also one of the rangers?

587
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,260
I plan to choose P’ Sing and P’ Mond.

588
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,600
Will you choose them?

589
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,219
I’m not surprised that you want to choose Mond.

590
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,100
But I’m surprised that you want to choose me.

591
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,399
I played a game with you once.

592
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,320
You were agile.

593
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
HE’S RELIEVED.

594
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,199
So your first pick is…?

595
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,080
P’ White.

596
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,260
AN UNEXPECTED CHOICE.

597
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,100
HE IS A TOUGH GUY.

598
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,320
Congrats, bro.

599
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,600
He finally gets chosen.

600
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,219
Based on your choice, I guess you didn’t watch this show much.

601
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,060
Next, Earth. Who will you choose to be the second member of your team?

602
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,120
P’ Arm WC.

603
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,780
THE ACE.

604
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,780
He’s an intimidating choice.

605
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,780
IMPROVE HIS STRENGTH.

606
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,980
I’m ready to win.

607
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,780
First.

608
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,260
I’ll choose an ace, P’ Nicky.

609
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,840
AS PROMISED.
Who did you choose earlier?

610
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,640
P’ Nicky, P’ Gun, and me.

611
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,700
HE LOVES THE TEAM.

612
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,379
P’ Tay.

613
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,040
REALLY?!

614
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,460
THEIR LUCKS ARE NOW CONNECTED.

615
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,420
I want to beat the curse of this show.

616
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,320
Back to Earth. Who will you choose to be your third member?

617
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,620
Analyze your choice first.

618
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,379
I want to break the rule of this show.

619
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,040
AGAIN?!

620
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,899
HOW?

621
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,560
Newie.

622
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,180
ANOTHER TOUGH GUY.

623
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,400
This team is scary.

624
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,320
TOUGH TEAM.

625
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,560
Who is on the team?

626
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,460
Earth, New, and Arm.

627
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,680
First, you can choose anyone but Leo.

628
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,360
PLEASE CHOOSE ME.

629
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,719
Pick him.

630
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,920
I don’t want to be in First’s team.

631
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,180
No, choose the person next to him.

632
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,679
P’ Leo.

633
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,580
THIS WOULD BE FUN.

634
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,180
I’m afraid that the three teams wouldn’t be balanced.

635
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,960
I’m afraid that the three teams wouldn’t be balanced.

636
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,440
First!

637
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,260
It’s me.

638
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,480
Did you forget me?

639
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,840
First, Leo is a terrible choice.

640
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,439
I think we need an ace in our team.

641
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,620
Yes, we need one.
WHO IS HE?

642
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,100
Someone talented, fast, agile, and always won games.

643
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,959
HE MUST BE VERY TALENTED.

644
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
P’ Sing.

645
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,980
HE CAN’T BELIEVE HIS EARS.

646
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,080
Look at his face.

647
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,080
Good choice.

648
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,220
Now, I believe that you have never watched School Rangers.

649
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,020
THESE ARE ALL THE ACES.

650
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,440
We will end the curse.

651
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,040
HE HAS HIS GOAL.

652
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,420
This is a new era.

653
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,820
Just like soccer, this is the start of a new season.

654
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,980
Forget all the past.

655
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,560
Since we already come this way, I will choose…

656
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,160
DON’T CHOOSE ANOTHER TOUGH GUY.

657
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,960
WHO WILL IT BE?

658
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,000
I choose Mond.

659
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,139
ANOTHER TOUGH GUY.

660
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,300
I think my team is lack of strength.

661
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,440
In terms of strength, it’s going to be Chimon or Nanon.

662
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,400
I choose Nanon.

663
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,760
You never watched this show!

664
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,900
THIS WOULD BE FUN.

665
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,919
Nanon is worse than Leo and me.

666
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,940
His body is big. He must have some strength.

667
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,640
HE FOCUSES ON THE SIZE.

668
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,760
He still can’t find his strong point.

669
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,760
Who will you choose?

670
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,020
I intend to choose Chimon.

671
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,399
Let’s go to the extreme and begin a new era.

672
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,860
I want to see Mix’s team standing together the most.

673
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,379
Let’s stand with our teams.

674
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,620
After we have selected our teams,

675
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,640
I’ll give each team to talk about what is in their mind.

676
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,340
For Team A, let’s start with Gun.

677
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,160
I’m very happy that we have a chance to join a talk…

678
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,260
HE MUST BE SO EXCITED THAT HIS TONGUE GETS TWISTED.
A team.

679
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,300
…join the team with familiar faces such as P’ Leo and P’ Nicky.
HE MUST BE SO EXCITED THAT HIS TONGUE GETS TWISTED.
A team.

680
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,419
…join the team with familiar faces such as P’ Leo and P’ Nicky.

681
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,300
But you looked devastated earlier.

682
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:49,139
If we watch the moment that First said my name, Gun was totally devastated.

683
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,800
P’ Leo.

684
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,160
First!

685
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,800
I don’t want to be punished.

686
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,600
It’s me.

687
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,980
That’s not true.

688
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,380
Why?	How was it?

689
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,760
It was great. I just couldn’t believe that First would pick you.

690
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,640
HOW SHOULD I MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR THIS?
It was great. I just couldn’t believe that First would pick you.

691
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,600
It was unbelievable.

692
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,520
We were happy.
THAT’S WHAT HAPPENED.

693
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,640
You didn’t do it because you were unhappy.

694
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,300
HE WAS HAPPY.

695
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,020
What about when he picked me?

696
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,020
I’m very happy.

697
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,720
His eyes are lying.

698
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,200
Since we are in the same team today, we will go through it together.

699
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,380
HE ENDS IT ON A HIGH NOTE.

700
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,680
What about Team B?

701
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,760
Tell them, P’ Tay.

702
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,620
It’s destiny that brings us together.

703
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,260
You are all in Team B?

704
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,160
TEAM B GANG?

705
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,760
Your team looks quite worrisome.

706
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,500
Our team is quite talented.

707
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,000
You should worry about your team first.

708
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,900
THE KID TALKS BACK.

709
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
But Team C looks like they are not afraid of anything.

710
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,040
Look at their members.

711
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,460
They look like a tank.

712
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,480
THE TEAM IS FULL OF POWER.

713
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,160
Arm, you are standing like you are already the winner.
THE TEAM IS FULL OF POWER.

714
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,640
Arm, you are standing like you are already the winner.

715
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,500
What about this, combine Team A and B to compete against Team C?

716
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,620
We are not that good.

717
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,600
DON’T GANG UP ON US.
We are not that good.

718
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,080
I’m afraid that you still defeat us anyway.

719
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,460
LET’S FIGHT, SHALL WE?

720
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,399
If Team C is defeated today, the other two teams will be extremely happy.

721
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,120
LET’S WAIT AND SEE.

722
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:14,920
When we set up our teams and this filming is over, you will say that this is unexpected.

723
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,120
I WANT TO SAY IT NOW!

724
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,920
Team C, how do you feel?

725
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
I’m glad that he picked me first.

726
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,199
Because I’m already a part of his team.

727
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,979
I saw him adding more weapons to the team.

728
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,040
HE PLANNED IT WELL.

729
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,460
I felt that our team is special.

730
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,280
Full of aces.
WE ARE ALL ACES.

731
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,679
Right.

732
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
We need to name our teams, right?

733
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,400
That’s a must.
LET’S NAME OUR TEAMS.

734
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Let’s start with Team C.

735
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,080
The names of the teams need to be based on animal names.

736
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,300
Bantam.

737
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,660
Team B, what’s your team’s name?

738
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,880
Our team’s name…

739
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,560
LET’S DISCUSS FIRST.

740
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,480
If a rat fights, can you handle it? (Noo in Thai can mean both ‘a rat’ and ‘I’)
LET’S DISCUSS FIRST.

741
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,920
If a rat fights, can you handle it? (Noo in Thai can mean both ‘a rat’ and ‘I’)

742
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,200
The rat won’t lose.

743
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,679
We have Bantam and Rat. What about the last team?

744
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,900
Our team’s name comes from a frightening animal.

745
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,440
Spider.

746
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,060
What kind of spider?

747
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,060
Tarantula.

748
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,899
What do you hunt?

749
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,000
Let’s say goodbye for now. (La means ‘hunt’ and ‘goodbye’ in Thai)

750
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,380
THEY ARE PLAYING A EASY JOKE.
Let’s say goodbye for now. (La means ‘hunt’ and ‘goodbye’ in Thai)

751
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,760
UNEXPECTED.

752
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,379
He helped open the joke.

753
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,440
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

754
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,280
Three jokes.

755
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,399
HE IS SO PROUD.
Three jokes.

756
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,180
Three jokes.

757
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,140
Now the teams have been divided.

758
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,700
Their verbal skill is not worrisome.

759
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,080
What about their ability? Let’s see it in the next break.

760
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:45,760
Let’s go. It’s time for all the 15 rangers to do a mission together for the first time.

761
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,900
The new rangers have joined us in several missions as guests.

762
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,280
Will they be able to write a new history as they take on a new role?

763
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,700
Let’s check it out.

764
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,060
This mission is about agility.

765
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,100
Agility can be crucial quality to help you win in certain types of games.

766
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,320
Talking about agility, Leo…

767
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,639
Yes.

768
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,420
He’s the worst.

769
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,480
The person who is good at it is Gun, Arm, and Chimon.

770
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:18,900
Me, too.

771
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,660
DON’T FORGET ME.
Me, too.

772
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,700
Mix, you too?

773
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,240
I’m agile.

774
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,700
Let’s give him a try.

775
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,780
Let’s give him a try.

776
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,460
WAIT AND SEE.
Let’s give him a try.

777
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,600
WAIT AND SEE.

778
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,220
He’s there.

779
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,600
Gun and Chimon, can you tell us your secrets for agility?

780
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,060
I’m not sure if I have a secret for it.

781
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,200
When I play a game, I just want to finish it as fast as I can.

782
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,300
FOCUS ON THE GOAL.
I’m petit.

783
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
So I can move fast.

784
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,840
Are you afraid that you might fall down when you are in a high place?

785
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,560
No because I know that there are safety gears.

786
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,500
HE FEELS ASSURED.
No because I know that there are safety gears.

787
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:45,940
HE FEELS ASSURED.

788
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,940
What if there’s no safety gear?

789
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,440
I will be afraid.

790
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Why did you ask that?

791
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,260
SO WHAT?

792
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,639
Arm, what is your secret?

793
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,040
I have no secret as well. This is a gifted talent.

794
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,159
Even though we all do our best, the results are still different.

795
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,280
HE IS RIGHT.

796
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Then we don’t need to ask Chimon, do we?
HE IS RIGHT.

797
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,659
Then we don’t need to ask Chimon, do we?

798
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,860
Let’s ask him.

799
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,160
I just do my best. Work as hard as I can.

800
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,379
I will do my best because I want to beat this team.

801
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,300
A BIG OPPONENT.

802
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,860
Why does it have to be my team?
A BIG OPPONENT.

803
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,540
Why does it have to be my team?

804
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,540
Your team looks strong and all-rounded.

805
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,520
I saw Earth’s skills when we filmed the Boy Scout episodes.

806
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,960
Why?

807
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,799
You are just big.

808
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,480
Really?

809
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,780
But you were weak.

810
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,680
That was my acting.

811
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,020
You were weak and clumsie.

812
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,060
HIS TONGUE GETS TWISTED.

813
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,899
Let’s see this time.

814
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,360
Don’t judge me yet.

815
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,000
How will agility play a role in the first game?

816
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,360
Let’s see the rule of the game.

817
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,880
The rule of ‘The Higher, The Better’ game.

818
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,580
Each team will send one of its members to play the game in each round.

819
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,360
The players will use their agility to walk on a wobbly bridge.

820
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,720
They will use their head and knee to hit all the balloons along the course.

821
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,080
There are two rounds for this game.

822
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,740
Based on their total time record, each

823
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,859
team will receive 3, 2, and 1 point respectively.

824
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,140
I have never seen it before.
YOUR ACTING LOOKS SO NATURAL.

825
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,640
I look this way so I didn’t see it.

826
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,160
UNBELIEVABLE.
I’ve never seen it before.

827
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,700
This game is not hard for me at all.

828
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,280
I did it in the Powerful Hip game.

829
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,260
P’ Leo, Nonon, P’ Gun, Sing, and I had played the game.

830
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,100
I’m the best at using my hip

831
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,440
I’m the best in the field.

832
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,780
If I have to boast about it.

833
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,700
Leo

834
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,140
Yes.

835
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,880
He used to be good at it.

836
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,060
He was shrugging.

837
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,380
He’s getting older so he…

838
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,120
I’M SAD.
He’s getting older so he…

839
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,200
But his physical condition is not good now.

840
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,720
I’m not as agile as I used to be but now I start to feel angry at you.

841
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,279
HE HITS BACK.

842
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,980
See? He can make them rhyme.

843
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:58,220
The new rangers - First, Mix and Earth, will compete in the first round.

844
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,240
In the second round, each team can choose their player.

845
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,320
Gun from Team A raises his hand.

846
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,080
Team B sends Sing to compete in the game.

847
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,920
Team C gives the duty to Arm.

848
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,339
Based on the player, it will be a close game.

849
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,740
Team B, why do you send Sing to play the game?

850
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,140
The other members have drama filming schedules.

851
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,660
Sing doesn’t have a schedule for tomorrow.

852
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,359
I mean nothing to you.

853
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,580
HE LOVES HIS BRO.

854
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,960
If you get injured, it won’t affect your schedule.

855
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,120
I can get injured.

856
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,759
You can get injured.

857
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
But I won’t let my feelings get hurt.

858
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,100
How is my rhyme?

859
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,640
THE KID IS FIGHTING BACK.

860
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
When this team sends Sing, my team feels sorry (pun jokes).

861
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,460
THAT’S TOO INSULTING.

862
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,700
Rock, paper, scissors.

863
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,420
We won.

864
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,700
THEY WILL BE THE LAST TEAM TO PLAY.

865
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,820
You can observe the first team and it won’t feel so pressured since we are not the last to play.

866
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,580
Okay.

867
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,860
Team B will be the first to play.

868
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,580
Team A will go second.

869
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,660
Team C will be the last.

870
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,660
Let’s go.

871
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,040
How is it up there?

872
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,279
LET’S CHECK HIS CONDITION.
How is it up there?

873
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,540
At first, it doesn’t look scary.

874
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,340
What about now?

875
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,320
I’m so scared.

876
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,500
HE IS IN TROUBLE.

877
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,220
Don’t try to scare my team.

878
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,419
It’s okay. If you fall down, I’ll catch you.

879
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,100
I’M READY TO CATCH YOU.
It’s okay. If you fall down, I’ll catch you.

880
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,980
I don’t believe you.

881
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
You don’t need to hurry because First is scared of height.

882
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,040
HE KNOWS MY WEAKNESS.

883
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,040
First, you will lose this game.

884
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,400
You do it well first.

885
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,460
Mix, fighting!

886
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,120
We need to cheer on him. So he won’t be afraid.

887
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
It’s like we are there to catch him.

888
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,920
I’m afraid that he will fall on us.

889
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,120
Don’t be afraid.

890
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,620
Hurry up.

891
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,880
Easy. Be careful.

892
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,960
AFRAID BUT NOT GIVE UP.

893
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,760
We are here to catch you.

894
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,460
TAY TAWAN, THE CHEERLEADER.

895
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,279
READY TO CATCH HIM.

896
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
OH!?

897
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,740
His first few steps look fine. Then, he almost falls down.

898
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,720
HIS HEART SKIPS A BEAT.
His first few steps look fine. Then, he almost falls down.

899
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,980
KEEP GOING. DON’T STOP.

900
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,280
TAKE A BREAK.
What is he going to do?

901
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,860
Will he keep going or quit?

902
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,940
He needs to make the decision quickly as the clock is ticking.

903
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,040
MIX, FIGHT ON!

904
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,240
I’M AFRAID FOR HIM.

905
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,120
I hope First won’t be too afraid after watching his friend playing the game.
I’M AFRAID FOR HIM.

906
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,900
I hope First won’t be too afraid after watching his friend playing the game.

907
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,460
HE KEEPS WATCHING MIX.
Be brave.

908
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,740
Mix, keep going.

909
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,840
Take it easy.
HE HAS A FIGHTING SPIRIT.

910
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,459
WOBBLY.

911
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,360
The gold is waiting for you.

912
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,800
HIS CHEERING IS NON-SENSE.

913
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,700
Mix, fight on.

914
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,879
White, go and cheer on him.

915
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,480
NOT FAR TO THE FINISH LINE.

916
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,020
HE SCREAMS TO BEAT HIS FEAR.

917
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,480
Scream out loud.

918
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,260
RELEASE YOUR ENERGY.

919
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,580
Team C is secretly practicing their moves.

920
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,400
ALMOST THERE.

921
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,140
THE LAST THREE BALLOONS.

922
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,140
Above you.

923
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,720
I SURVIVED.

924
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,500
Mix, you are great.

925
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,460
That’s unexpected.

926
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,160
Superb.

927
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,020
That was fast.

928
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,920
My legs are shaking.

929
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,720
His legs are already shaking because he’s afraid of height.

930
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,240
HIS LEGS ARE NOT COOPERATING WITH HIM.
His legs are already shaking because he’s afraid of height.

931
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,360
We are in trouble.

932
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,800
It’s okay, First. This is nothing.

933
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,880
Don’t look down.

934
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,560
TRY TO COMFORT HIM.

935
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,299
It’s super scary. It’s really high.

936
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,920
The planks are wobbly.

937
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,300
I need to find my balance first.

938
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,540
If I’m not careful, I can fall down.

939
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,960
HE’S STILL TIRED.

940
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,960
My legs were shaking.

941
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,660
I was so scared.

942
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,279
I did it quickly because P’ Boy told me if I win the game, I will get additional money.

943
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,020
HE FOUGHT FOR THE PRIZE.

944
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,660
His strong point was that he screamed to relieve his stress.

945
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,660
He did it well from the first to the last screams.

946
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,520
If he fell down, we would run away from there.

947
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,420
Then I would run back to help him after he landed on the ground.

948
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
You are such a terrible friend.

949
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,000
I’m sure I can beat First.

950
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,880
LET’S WAIT AND SEE.

951
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,680
The picture I had in my head vs. reality.

952
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,720
It’s scarier?

953
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,060
It’s scarier than I thought.

954
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,240
These two big bros will send moral support to you

955
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,940
First – my friend, it’s okay.

956
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,220
I passed it.

957
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,620
Be careful not to fall down.

958
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,120
Relax, First. Nothing is higher than our heart.

959
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,399
I showed you how to do it. Now you know what to do.

960
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,320
My anger spikes up.

961
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,860
Wait and see.

962
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,799
I’ll wait and see.
CALM DOWN, BRO.

963
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,260
Wait and see.

964
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,480
You haven’t shown your physical skill but your verbal skill is second to none.

965
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,380
Take it easy.

966
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,200
Take step by step.

967
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,640
SLOW BUT SECURE.

968
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,200
Keep going.

969
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,180
Left and right.

970
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,180
That’s pretty fast.

971
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,379
HE’S EXCITED.

972
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,460
Keep going.

973
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,360
THE CROWD IS VERY EXCITED.

974
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,860
First, be careful.

975
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,500
First is trying to stay calm to beat his fear.

976
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,060
While his teammates seem to be more excited than him.

977
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,479
First, you are doing well.

978
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,839
THEY ARE SO LOUD.

979
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,740
STUDY THE OPPONENT.
Team C is quiet observing him,

980
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,660
Team C is quiet observing him,

981
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,200
Are they feeling nervous or are they planning something?

982
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,859
Take it easy.

983
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,720
ALMOST THERE.

984
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,819
HE’S LOWERING HIS BODY.

985
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,880
He uses this technique.

986
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,940
HERE COMES THE DOUBLE-KNEE STRIKE.

987
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,440
FIGHT ON, BRO.

988
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,340
He’s pretty fast.

989
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,100
HE IS SPEEDING UP.

990
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,400
HE STARTS TO WORRY.
Between him and me, who is faster?

991
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,960
THE SHAPE OF HIS LIPS SAYS EVERYTHING.

992
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,960
Between First and me, who is faster?

993
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,200
Pretty much the same.

994
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,060
HE IS CHANGING HIS RESPONSE.

995
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,140
IT ALMOST ENDS.

996
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,280
JUST ONE MORE STEP.

997
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,540
Unlike me, he doesn’t waste any time when piercing the balloons.

998
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,080
Heading.

999
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,920
HE IS ROOTING FOR FIRST.

1000
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,120
It’s the last balloon. First, hurry up and end the game.

1001
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,740
WELL DONE.

1002
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,620
It’s not that scary.

1003
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,380
That was fast, bro.

1004
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,660
It wasn’t as scary as I had thought.

1005
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,220
NOW HE BECOMES VERY VOCAL.
It wasn’t as scary as I had thought.

1006
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,959
NOW HE BECOMES VERY VOCAL.

1007
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,560
Why did you take so long?

1008
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,740
I missed the ballons.

1009
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,759
First, you were so fast.

1010
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,360
I like this technique of you.

1011
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,660
I LOVE IT.

1012
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
That was very fast.

1013
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,160
It’s okay. We still have Sing.

1014
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,140
The soldier doesn’t end, don’t count the war.

1015
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,900
The war hasn’t ended.

1016
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,560
It wasn’t that scary.

1017
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,520
Was I fast? I think I was pretty fast.

1018
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,380
HE RETURNS TO HIGH SPIRITS NOW.
Was I fast? I think I was pretty fast.

1019
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,419
This is a hidden gift inside me.

1020
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,419
I think it’s great that I found a new talent in the game.

1021
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,820
Can you tell us your true feeling?

1022
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,220
My legs were shaking since the first step.

1023
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,720
Why didn’t you scream?

1024
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,140
I was too afraid to scream.

1025
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,799
During the game, it was scary.

1026
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,900
But it was scarier when I climbed down.

1027
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,800
First did very well from observing Mix.

1028
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,960
Mix was quite slow and took a long time to finish.

1029
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,460
From my observation, First was much faster.

1030
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,480
He might be faster than me.

1031
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
At first, I thought you would be slower than Mix.

1032
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,640
But when you did it, you had your rhythm and barely made any mistake.

1033
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,319
LET’S PRAISE HIM.

1034
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,759
Now is time for the last team of this round.

1035
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,000
After studying the game for a while, Earth, it’s time to show your skill.

1036
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,020
Did you see examples from the two previous players?

1037
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,720
Yes.

1038
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,720
Those are amateurs.

1039
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
But you are…

1040
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
…a bunch. (pun jokes on Thai words)

1041
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,600
I can say I’m second to none.

1042
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:31,620
TOTALLY CONFIDENT.

1043
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,220
Listen here. Someone wants to say something to you.
TOTALLY CONFIDENT.

1044
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,560
Listen here. Someone wants to say something to you.

1045
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,660
You can do it.

1046
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,819
MORAL SUPPORT.

1047
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,940
Thank you.

1048
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,080
He didn’t know it was our plan.

1049
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,259
But he gains strength from it.

1050
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,960
Then our plan went wrong.

1051
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,840
Will Tay’s plan to falsely praise Earth work?

1052
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,840
Let’s see.

1053
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,440
Go. Keep going.

1054
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,520
The game is over.

1055
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,120
SUPER FAST.

1056
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,580
ARE YOU IN A RUSH?

1057
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,960
Tay’s plan doesn’t work with Earth.

1058
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,760
He is unstoppable and as fast as lightning.

1059
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,620
HE DOESN’T MAKE A SINGLE MISTAKE.

1060
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,180
SUPER SCARY.

1061
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,759
He’s very fast.

1062
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,520
HE’S THE REAL DEAL.

1063
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,720
Take it easy, Earth.

1064
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,700
WHY IS HE SO FAST?

1065
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,920
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

1066
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,920
THE PLAN FAILS.

1067
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,900
HE IS SO CHILL.

1068
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,720
Earth is going forwards at a fast speed.

1069
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,600
He’s not afraid nor stoppable.

1070
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,000
He’s too strong.

1071
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,320
THEY FEEL RELAXED NOW.
He’s too strong.

1072
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,180
Pierce it. Left and right.

1073
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,160
HE’S NOT SLOWING DOWN AT ALL.

1074
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,480
EARTH IS COMING.

1075
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,840
AMAZING.

1076
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,460
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

1077
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,660
SO PROUD.

1078
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,279
Your plan to cheer for him.

1079
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,640
The plan went wrong.

1080
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,640
Let’s get him some support so he would be overconfident.

1081
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,900
But he did so well.

1082
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,720
THANK YOU, BUDDY.

1083
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,720
Did you see it?

1084
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,720
It’s like we already won since the first round.

1085
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,620
I’m not here to lose. I’m here to win.

1086
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,080
I’M SERIOUS.
I’m not here to lose. I’m here to win.

1087
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,720
I’M SERIOUS.

1088
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,600
You kept stepping forward nonstop.

1089
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,259
Yes, but deep down, I was nervous.

1090
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,200
But I only thought I had to do it faster than the other two teams.

1091
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,779
Were your scared/

1092
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,740
I’m not afraid of height.

1093
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,680
First was wrong. This time I won’t take it easy on him.

1094
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,259
I’M HERE TO WIN.
First was wrong. This time I won’t take it easy on him.

1095
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,280
Let’s give Earth round applause.
First was wrong. This time I won’t take it easy on him.

1096
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,560
Let’s give Earth round applause.

1097
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,080
THE PRIDE OF THE TEAM.
Let’s give Earth round applause.

1098
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,520
THE PRIDE OF THE TEAM.

1099
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,200
How was I?

1100
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,080
You were very fast. I thought you were the god of thunder.

1101
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,940
He made me unexpectedly proud.

1102
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,759
I thought he would be hasty.

1103
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,480
But he wasn’t at all.

1104
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
There is a jealous team next to us.

1105
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,400
DON’T SHOW IT.

1106
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:56,900
Where?

1107
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,540
This is easy.

1108
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,060
The next round will be easy too.

1109
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,080
Yes, if Sing starts the game.

1110
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,240
But I’m worried about Gun.

1111
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,660
Gun will be fast.

1112
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,560
Don’t say you are worried. Say you are afraid.

1113
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,720
IS IT THAT BAD?

1114
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,120
When it comes to speed, he is no.1.

1115
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,260
This fun in this week is over.

1116
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,520
But don’t be so quick to judge.

1117
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,020
It’s not certain who will win the game.

1118
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,600
The first round allows the three new

1119
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,420
rangers – First, Earth, and Mix to show their potential.

1120
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,720
They all have fighting spirits.

1121
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,120
They will be able to compete with the veteran rangers just fine.

1122
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,819
How will the result of this game turn out? Check it out next week.

1123
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:51,720
Thank you, the Verona at Tab Lan in Prachinburi, for the filming location.

1124
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,080
It’s close to Bangkok, with only 2-3 hours of driving.

1125
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,680
The air is fresh and the accommodations are comfortable.

1126
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,980
It’s a great place for a family vacation.

1127
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:06,000
If you are an adventure lover, there are many obstacles for you to enjoy.

1128
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,060
There’s also a flower garden for photo shooting.

1129
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,800
Thank you.

1130
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,340
The players in the second round are also as good as those in the first round.

1131
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,580
Who will win the first game?

1132
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,460
Find out in the next episode, airing next Saturday at noon.
