00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,700
Ranger Gun, Sing, and Arms will challenge the height activity.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,900
They need to stay balanced and hit the balloons with their knees.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,040
The next mission, Harmony Balance Board, requires teamwork and balancing skills.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,440
Let’s see if they will be able to pass the mission.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,720
The following mission requires arm and leg strength for rock climbing.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,680
Then they have to use their brain to figure out the answers.

10
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,780
Let’s see how much they can improve their ranger skills.

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,840
Let’s check it out in School Rangers: Intro to Rangers.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:33,640
Before watching this week's episode, let’s take a time machine to last week's episode for a recap of their performance.

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,820
They kicked off with a workshop to get to know the new rangers and learn about each other.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,520
Hu!

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,140
Ha!

16
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,720
Hi!

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,340
Hu!

18
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,800
Ha!

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,200
Hi!

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,560
Hu!

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,020
Ha!

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,420
Hi!

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,160
Hu!

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,700
Ha!

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,480
Hi!

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,960
Hu!

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,559
Ha!

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,200
Hi!

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,840
Hu!

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,420
Ha!

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,620
You lost!

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,880
The first one to be eliminated is White.

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,660
Do you remember that one ranger had so much fun in the game that he ripped his pants?

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,100
Hi!

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,580
Hu!

36
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,039
Ha!

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,420
Hi!

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,220
Hu!

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,820
Ha!

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,640
Because of his overacting, Nicky got into trouble.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,399
His pants were ripped into a big hole.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,739
And these are Dior!

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,900
They’re not used to strenuous work, huh?

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,940
He sacrificed himself for laughter and fun.

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,380
Please give Nicky a round of applause.

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,860
After the workshop,

47
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,220
it was time for them to get change and boost their energy in the real mission ‘The Higher, The Louder’.

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,640
In the first round, the new rangers were selected to show their skills that would surprise the veteran rangers.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,299
Would it be a good surprise or a bad one? We needed to wait and see.

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,480
First, be careful.

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,399
P’ First, be careful.

52
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,880
Mix, keep going.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,740
Take it easy.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Earth was moving forwards at a fast speed.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,220
He was hitting the targets nonstop.

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,740
He was too strong.

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,740
Take it easy.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,060
After taking the time machine, there is no time for a break.

59
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,400
To become a good ranger, they need to strike while the iron is hot.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,840
If you are ready, let’s go.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
Are you confident?

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
I’m nervous.

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
The victory is in front of you.

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,260
Sure.

65
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,920
Your name is Sing. You should speed up.

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,859
HE RECEIVES AN ENCOURAGEMENT.

67
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
That’s good encouragement.

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,760
Are you scared?

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
Stop talking. Let’s begin.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,220
After the whistle sound, Sing doesn’t waste his time.

71
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,800
Keep moving.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,880
Keep going.

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,040
HE IS REALLY INTO THE GAME.
Moving fast.

74
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,440
Sing is moving towards the other end.

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,980
He hits the balloons left and right.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,440
Being agile like a rat.

77
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,180
Being agile like a mus.

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,120
HERE COMES A MUS.
Being agile like a mus.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Being agile like a mus.

80
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,880
He seems to lose his balance a bit. He needs to stay focused.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,720
That’s fast.

82
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,020
When he can focus again, his steps continue at ease.

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,219
Take it easy.

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,240
Sing loses his balance again at this step.		How will the game end?

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,260
Take it easy.
THIS IS EXCITING.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,100
Be careful.

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,840
Keep going.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Sing is getting close to the finish line.

89
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,420
It’s only a few steps away from the last balloon.

90
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,680
Faster. Faster than a cheetah.

91
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,260
HE LOOKS DISAPPOINTED.

92
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,260
It’s neck-to-neck.

93
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,520
You’re so good. I didn’t know you would be this good.

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

95
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,539
I’m pretty good.

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,020
You didn’t scream at all. How did you feel?

97
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,060
It wasn’t that scary but the boards were shaking.

98
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,440
I think I was doing alright.

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,780
IT WASN’T BAD.
I think I was doing alright.

100
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,239
I think I was doing alright.

101
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
We need to see how fast the other two teams will be.

102
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,480
I don’t think I was neither fast nor slow.

103
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,599
I’m not afraid if the height is this high.

104
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,580
I just don’t like wavering and thrilling feelings of it.
THIS IS A PIECE OF CAKE.

105
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,440
I just don’t like wavering and thrilling feelings of it.

106
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,760
Now, it’s up to the other teams whether they will be faster than me.

107
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,760
You were going fast.

108
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,960
Chimon, do you think who was faster? P’ Sing or P’ Mix?

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,359
Please define Mix’s speed.

110
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,960
It’s a kind of fast.

111
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,340
It’s quite fast.

112
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,760
Sing was pretty fast.

113
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,460
The other teams were faster.

114
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,460
HOW SO?

115
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,700
To be honest, they both did well.

116
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,940
Are you giving me a kiss after a kick?

117
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,219
Good job.

118
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,080
He hasn’t done anything.
CALM DOWN.

119
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,500
You need to be fast.

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,260
Fight on, P’ Gun.

121
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,020
Fight on, Gun.

122
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,960
Faster, Faster.

123
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,940
Do you see it?

124
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,700
From the beginning, Gun is blasting the balloons nonstop.

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,460
Nothing can stop him.

126
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,700
He keeps moving forwards.

127
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,920
It’s okay. Don’t pay attention to the hands.

128
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,120
Go, go, go!

129
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,940
SPEEDY MOUSE.

130
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,479
What is happening to Gun? It seems like he is having a problem.

131
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,020
He needs to speed up.

132
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,719
Keep going.

133
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,980
He is getting close to the finish line.

134
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,760
Don’t give up, Mini Mouse.

135
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Heading towards the last balloon. Go, Go, Go!

136
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,160
That’s so fast.

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,920
That’s super fast.

138
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,060
EVERYONE IS SHOCKED.

139
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,320
Is this someone who said he was scared?

140
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,260
You’ve never disappointed me.

141
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,380
I was scared that I might lose.

142
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,420
You were scared that you might lose.

143
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,760
I was nervous because Earth was very fast.

144
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,260
So I felt that I need to be fast too. I’m not sure if I was as fast as Earth.

145
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,560
There was a small problem in the middle. I couldn’t break a balloon.

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
Let’s wait and see how well I did.

147
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,180
Great job.

148
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,860
Was I fast?

149
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,080
Yes. Your speed is similar to Earth’s.

150
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,460
Well done. You’ve never disappointed me.

151
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,380
THE BIG BROTHERS KEEP PRAISING HIM.
We picked the right players.

152
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,060
First did better than I had expected.

153
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,420
Gun was as good as I had expected.

154
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,120
This is what it is called ‘follow belt’.

155
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,760
What is it?

156
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,280
As expected.

157
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,460
‘Follow belt’ (literally translation), don’t forget to share it.

158
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,820
Arm is mad that I said that he was a perfect man.

159
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
So he is very serious about the game.

160
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,340
He said he will reclaim his title this year. Let’s see if he can do it.

161
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,740
You will win.

162
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,800
Wait. That’s their team.

163
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,940
I ENJOY IT TOO MUCH.

164
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,900
Arm looks stressed.

165
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,700
I’m tired already.

166
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,039
P’ Arm, the worst thing is that you are defeated by First.

167
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,280
This is your honor, P’ Arm.

168
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,940
YOU CAN’T LOSE.
This is your honor, P’ Arm.

169
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,420
P’ Arm, don’t let them win. Show them your move.

170
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
HE SHOWS HIS FIGHTING SPIRIT THROUGH A SMILE.

171
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,940
Faster, faster.

172
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,580
Our perfect man starts off with a bit of difficulty.

173
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,419
He is a bit shaking. Please send him support.

174
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,440
This is your honor.

175
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,080
Be careful.

176
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,380
He continues smoothly.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,020
This step is a big challenge. Every player made mistakes here.

178
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,300
Faster.

179
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,280
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

180
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,159
He’s heading towards the last balloon.

181
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,799
That’s neck-to-neck.

182
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,199
It’s quite tiring and tense.

183
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,020
I think I did well.

184
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,160
Along with Earth’s good performance earlier, our team did double well.

185
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,480
They did great. Both of them used only 25 seconds.

186
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,380
Gun is the only one who was faster than them.

187
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,460
But 25 seconds are considered very fast.

188
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,280
Gun is petit but very talented.

189
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
There’s one thing I’m worried about.

190
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,959
What is it?

191
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,700
I’m worried about Team B.

192
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,160
Will they be able to revive their fighting spirit?

193
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,180
I feel bad for them.
True.

194
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,300
They made a mistake from the beginning.
We already know how it’s going to end.

195
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,260
Please reveal the result, Godji.

196
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,040
In the first round between Earth, First, and Mix.

197
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,020
Let’s cross our fingers.

198
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,540
There’s nothing to hope for.

199
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,760
One of them used 55 seconds.

200
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,939
WHO IS HE?

201
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,020
That person is…

202
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,079
…Mix

203
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,640
You did well.

204
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,420
First used 47 seconds.

205
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,280
That was close.

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,900
Earth used 25 seconds.

207
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,720
WELL DONE.
In the 1st round,

208
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,920
Team C receives 3 points.

209
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,180
Team A receives 2 points.

210
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,939
Team B receive 1 point.

211
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,719
We got 2 points.

212
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,580
In the 2nd round, Sing used 34 seconds.

213
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,560
That was fast.
IT’S NOT BAD.

214
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,180
Arm used 25 seconds.

215
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,920
The time they both used is equal to the time that Mix used.

216
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Gun Atthaphan used…

217
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,840
…22 seconds.

218
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,000
Team A receives 3 points.

219
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,719
Team C receives 2 points.

220
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,580
Team B receives 1 point.

221
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,180
The total points of Team A and Team C are 5 points.

222
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,180
Team B has 2 points.

223
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,839
Gun is great.

224
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,520
1, 2, 3. Hey, Hey, Hey!

225
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,520
Show your team spirit.

226
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,199
Hey, hey, hey.

227
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,420
What do you think about their performance in the 1st mission of Intro to Rangers episodes?

228
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,660
Both the veteran and rookie rangers showed off the skills that they have.

229
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,819
This is just the beginning. Many missions are waiting for them.

230
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,619
To be perfect rangers, they need to have not only agility but also teamwork.

231
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,140
So we prepare this mission for them.

232
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,580
This mission requires balancing skills.

233
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,340
But balancing skill is only one of the skills required for the game.

234
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,800
The other main skill required is teamwork.

235
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,560
I have done some research by watching the 200 episodes of our show.

236
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,439
The team which had good teamwork always won.

237
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,360
THE FACT IS CONFIRMED.

238
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,760
So I want to ask every team, do you think your team has good teamwork?

239
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,620
Let’s begin with Team A.

240
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,580
The teamwork of Team A is incomparable.

241
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,719
Among GMMTV artists, Nicky and Leo represent a long-lasting friendship.

242
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,680
They have been through good and bad together for a long time.

243
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,380
So our team has great teamwork.

244
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,060
What about Team B?

245
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,400
Since we have no other skill, we should have teamwork.

246
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,939
We also have an ace couple.

247
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,740
Who?

248
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,480
P’ White and P’ Sing.

249
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,500
THEY ARE NOT BACKING DOWN.

250
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,960
But you cannot leave me out from the team.

251
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,400
Right, then the team wouldn’t be complete.

252
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
It has to be White, Mond, and Sing.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,579
I have to say that he adds weight to the team.

254
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,300
He helps keep the balance.

255
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,140
I’ll wait and see how you are doing in the game.

256
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,600
Alright.

257
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,839
I’m going crazy.

258
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,240
What about Team C?

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
I think my team has a great balance.

260
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,380
Did you see that New did the handstand when we had lunch?

261
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,920
He likes to do pushups as well.

262
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,219
Mond is also someone special. If he

263
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,220
didn’t have balance skills, he wouldn’t be able to build up his body like this.

264
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,460
Arm, we don’t need to worry about him because he’s a perfect man.

265
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,260
I ride a surf skate.

266
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,540
Why don’t you talk about yourself?

267
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,560
I want to talk about others first.

268
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,859
HE TRIES TO GET AWAY FROM THIS.
I want to talk about others first.

269
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,740
I have Meniere’s disease.

270
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,920
Really?

271
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,440
I’m not sure but I’m very bad at anything that requires balancing skills.

272
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,100
Okay, I get it.
I’M ROOTING FOR YOU.

273
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,460
Thank you for choosing me to be a part of your team.

274
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,040
I’m very glad that I’m in Team C today.

275
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,160
Let’s see how teamwork is related to this game.

276
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,480
Let’s check out the rules of the game.

277
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,560
The rules of the balancing board.

278
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
Each team will send three players to play.

279
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,500
They need to stand and balance the board not to touch the ground for 5 seconds.

280
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,100
The team which can successfully do it in 90 seconds will receive 3 points.

281
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,600
If they can do it in 2 minutes, they will receive 2 points.

282
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,280
If they can do it in 3 minutes, they will receive 1 point.

283
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,680
If they fail, they will receive no point.

284
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,380
In this game, teamwork is very essential.

285
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,700
Now, you know the rules.

286
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,080
This game does not require only teamwork.

287
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,480
The weight of the players also plays an important role in the game.

288
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,800
It can affect the result.

289
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,839
It will affect the balaence.

290
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,780
Balance.

291
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,000
Who will you send to play the game?

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,860
Let’s start with Team A.

293
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,940
The weight of each member in my team is not much different because we already talked about it.

294
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,600
So it doesn’t matter who we will send to play the game.

295
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,960
Am I right, Nicky?

296
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,380
Yes.

297
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,160
But among all the rangers, I think New will have the best performance in this game.

298
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,819
Why?

299
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,900
Because he is well-known internationally.

300
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,280
He is New Balance.

301
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,839
I don’t think this game is hard for us.

302
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Here.

303
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,640
Here and here.

304
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,420
THEY ALL ARE THE ACES.
Here and here.

305
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,180
THEY ALL ARE THE ACES.

306
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,920
We need a young guy to balance between two old men.

307
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,780
Do you think how much time do you need to make it?

308
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,280
Three

309
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,240
Seconds?

310
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,860
Days.

311
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,380
THAT’S TOO LONG.

312
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,480
Team B.

313
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
Chimon and I have similar weights.

314
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,260
We will use a pin in the middle to balance us.

315
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,600
I’m the most secure pin in the team.

316
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,320
But you fell when you went to the restroom earlier.

317
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
No, I will be the pin.

318
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,060
Let’s move on to that team.

319
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,120
I’ll be the man in the middle in both rounds.

320
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,220
I’ll let the other two take care of the rest.

321
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,160
Who are they?

322
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,280
Our members’ weights are 70, 70, 66 and 67 kg.

323
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,940
We will keep the baelance. So wait and see how it’s going to be.

324
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,420
No one corrects my word.

325
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:28,900
Balance!

326
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,920
I don’t know what Team A is thinking.

327
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,300
Team B seems to think too much.

328
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
Team C is very confident.

329
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,839
Let’s see how we are doing in the game.

330
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,980
Rock, paper, scissors?

331
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,800
The loser will play first, right?

332
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

333
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,620
Rock, paper, scissors.

334
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,460
We will play last.

335
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,440
If we lose and have to play first, we will be at disadvantage.

336
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,540
You are talking too much.

337
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,000
Let’s do rock, paper, scissors.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,260
Rock, paper, scissors

339
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,860
What will you show?

340
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,760
I don’t know.

341
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,480
No, don’t do this.

342
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,440
Turn around.

343
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,480
There are many people. Stop flirting.

344
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,700
Rock, paper, scissors

345
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,860
He shows rock.

346
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:18,540
The order of the team playing the game is Team B, Team C, and Team A respectively.

347
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,939
Let’s go.

348
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,240
Let’s hear the first team who will be the first to play this game talks about their feelings.

349
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,280
Are you confident?

350
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,100
They are so confident that their hands sweat a lot.

351
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,040
Okay, are you ready?

352
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,040
Get on.

353
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,819
I can’t.

354
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,860
Okay.

355
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,440
Then slowly move towards the center.

356
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,460
The players of Team B are already on the board.

357
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,580
They are trying to find the balance.

358
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,240
P’ Sing moves towards the center.

359
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,040
No, we can’t do this.

360
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,560
We need to transfer the weight.
HE IS SO STIFF.

361
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,200
I won’t say anything otherwise the board will shake.

362
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,460
Let’s start again. We need to transfer the weight.

363
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:54,540
THEY ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

364
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,900
1, 2, 3.
THEY ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

365
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,520
1, 2, 3.

366
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,060
They are struggling at the beginning but this time they can keep the balance for 3 seconds.

367
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,060
This is a good start.

368
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,460
Let’s start again. We need to transfer the weight.

369
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,180
1, 2, 3.

370
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,179
Don’t start yet.

371
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,620
Do it slowly.

372
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,359
Push it your way.

373
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,199
If the board is about to lose its balance, you need to push your side.

374
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,680
1, 2, 3.

375
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,120
Push your side.

376
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
You need to fight my weight.

377
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,339
If it’s coming my way, you need to push.
Okay.

378
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,439
1, 2, 3, go!

379
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,620
Not yet. I can’t.

380
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:35,139
After they can keep the balance for 3 seconds, they seem to be unable to keep the balance for more than 1-2 seconds.

381
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,400
Keep trying.

382
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,220
Who will control the balance?

383
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,640
Only one person should be responsible for transferring the weight.

384
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
THEY ARE DISCUSSING THE STRATEGY.
Right. The man in the middle has to do it.

385
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,020
How can I help?

386
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
It’s hard.

387
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,139
1, 2, 3.

388
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,340
THEY ALMOST MAKE IT.

389
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,159
They can keep the balance for 3 seconds once again.

390
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
They almost made it.

391
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,680
Keep working together and find the balance, Team B.

392
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,540
Push towards the back.

393
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,500
How should we help them?

394
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,000
There’s nothing we can do.

395
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
THEY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING.
There’s nothing we can do.

396
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,899
THEY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING.

397
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,740
1, 2, 3.

398
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,720
Sing, push.

399
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,880
I think you need to move towards the center.

400
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,680
THEY ARE ROOTING FOR THE TEAMMATES.

401
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,480
1, 2.

402
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
THIS TAKES TOO LONG.
Tell me when you’re done.

403
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
I think it will take a while for this team to make it.

404
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,340
The other rangers are watching them closely.

405
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,540
I want to hear that they finally make it to 5 seconds.

406
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,940
You are close.

407
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,540
Don’t get angry.

408
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,880
This is hard.

409
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,220
THEY LOOK STRESSED.
Fight on.

410
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,360
Team B already spent 90 seconds in the game.

411
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,060
Now, they can change the players but the points they can receive will go down to 2 points.

412
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,160
1, 2, 3.

413
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,880
They can keep the board above the ground for 3 seconds now.

414
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Let’s cheer on Team B.

415
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,620
4, 5.

416
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,200
They finally made it.

417
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,260
But before they can make it, they spent some time in trial and error.

418
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,460
They kept shaking to the right and left.

419
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,980
The closest they could get to the goal was that they could keep the balance for 3 seconds.

420
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,480
In the end, with their never-ending effort, they finally made it.

421
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,480
Team C, you saw an example, which can be either good or bad, from Team B.

422
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,400
What’s our strategy?

423
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,440
Off looks so nervous.

424
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,840
We will let P’ Off control everything.

425
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,580
Sure.

426
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,340
Clockwise moment equals anticlockwise moment.

427
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,399
HE IS AN EXPERT ON THE THEORY.
New,

428
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,020
come to this side and help lift Arm up.

429
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,500
I’ll lift him onto the board.

430
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Are you going to start now? Are you ready?

431
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
I’m very ready.

432
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,480
Off, standing in the middle.

433
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
On the beam?

434
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,139
Yes.

435
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,380
If you are ready, Team C steps upon the board.

436
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,020
Show them how good you are.

437
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
We almost got it.

438
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,560
P’ Arm, keep your legs wide.

439
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,520
VERY FOCUSED.
P’ Arm, keep your legs wide.

440
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,940
VERY FOCUSED.

441
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,020
P’ Arm, move a little further.

442
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,900
Hold on to me.

443
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,680
P’ Arm, push.

444
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,240
Why P’ Arm is heavy?

445
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,320
1, 2.

446
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,800
P’ Arm, push.

447
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,760
1, 2, 3.

448
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:14,040
They almost made it several times.	But they can only keep the balance for only 1-2 seconds.

449
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,600
When will they make it to 5 seconds?

450
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,600
1, 2.

451
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,899
You need to move a bit to that side.

452
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,540
Okay, wait a sec.

453
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,640
Go.

454
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,540
1

455
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,480
It looks like they are sbhooting a magazine.

456
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,460
You are having fun teasing them.

457
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,200
Those on the board need to stay focused. Be careful not to lose your focus because of the teasing.

458
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,660
Let’s find the balance first.

459
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,900
1

460
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,400
Push.

461
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,940
Handsome guys want to do good deeds on the weekend.

462
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,440
Off stays in the middle.

463
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,720
Mond, transfer your weight to the center.

464
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,959
This team has started counting 1 several

465
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,700
times but they should move to 2 and 3.

466
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,480
I think the man in the middle needs to spread his legs to keep the balance.

467
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,200
Why can’t you do it?

468
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,880
Wait a sec.

469
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,840
Should the man in the middle spread his legs?

470
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,899
Let’s try it.

471
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,600
THEY ARE CHANGING THEIR PLAN.

472
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,940
They are changing their position.

473
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,320
Let’s give it a try. Things may get better.

474
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,060
90 seconds has passed. You can change the players if you want.

475
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,179
New, do you want to give it a try?

476
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,680
90 seconds have passed.

477
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,240
Team C changes their plan by sending New in to fix the situation.

478
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,780
Let’s see how they are doing.

479
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,780
Only two of us can’t do it.

480
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,460
1, 2.

481
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,100
Almost got it.

482
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,379
You need to stay still and I’ll control the balance.

483
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,820
1, 2, 3, 4.

484
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,740
They finally reach 4 seconds.

485
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,140
They are in the right direction.

486
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,780
Stay still. I’ll control it.

487
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,260
Go.

488
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,340
Wait a sec.

489
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,159
After New stepped in, they look promising.

490
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,920
1, 2, 3.

491
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,600
Only 2 seconds are left. They need to keep the balance.

492
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,360
Will they be able to do it?

493
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,000
4, 5.

494
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,280
They have lost many sweats before they accomplish the mission.

495
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,560
In the beginning, they were very confident.

496
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,940
As time passed, they became uncertain.

497
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,280
They also changed the player in the middle of the game.

498
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,879
That’s why they are called ‘braggers’.

499
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,760
My team has a good balance.

500
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,840
It was not easy for the first two teams.

501
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,620
So let’s give them a break to calm down and improve their mood.

502
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,320
Then let’s see Team A’s performance in the next break. We will see if they doing well or not.

503
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,379
Team A may be on the rise, but this game could be a little intimidating.

504
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,700
It is obvious that the previous two teams were having a hard time with it.

505
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,440
It looks like Team A is ready to play.

506
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,199
How you doing, Team A?

507
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,800
My team is obviously stronger.

508
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,460
And we spent so long to complete this game.

509
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,780
NOT A COMPLIMENT?

510
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,320
I thought you were complimenting us.

511
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,720
Let’s see how Team A will do.

512
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,660
Since there are many elderly people, I wonder how it’ll be for them.

513
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,440
LOOKING DOWN ON TEAM A.

514
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,980
Looking down on us like that could be a mistake.

515
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,440
How’s it a mistake?

516
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,820
We’re right.

517
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,240
It is a mistake. I’ll show you not all old people are inefficient.

518
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,780
UNDER PRESSURE.

519
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,740
And?

520
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,860
They are capable!

521
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,180
You get on it.

522
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,240
Now, my turn.

523
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,520
And then you get on it.

524
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,080
Slowly balancing the weight.

525
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,580
ROOTING FOR THEM.

526
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,980
Stand just like P’Leo.

527
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,620
This team looks like they’ve got a good plan with Nanon taking the lead.

528
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,900
Try balancing it.

529
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,760
P’Leo, your balance.

530
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,220
Alright, slowly.

531
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,880
Keep calm, everyone. In three, two, one.

532
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,720
The plank’s balancing nicely right there, but let’s see how it’ll turn out.

533
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,540
One, two, three, four, five.

534
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,740
And they did it!

535
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,160
CONFUSION.

536
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,380
That was fast.

537
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,020
OVER THE MOON.

538
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:32,940
After seeing the failures of the previous teams, Team A, led by Nanon, came up with a plan right away.

539
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,900
They’ve got teamwork, good leadership, and great cooperation.

540
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,620
And it paid off just as the genius team expected.

541
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
Told you this game isn’t about strength.

542
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,260
It’s all about balance.

543
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,080
These two have been on earth longer so they know where the balance is.

544
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,260
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT?

545
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,860
That’s why my team did better.
WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING AT?

546
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,959
I didn’t wanna say anything much.

547
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,100
So proud.

548
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,120
THEY DID IT.

549
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,040
That was just practice for them to get the gist of the game.

550
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,840
Each team still has one more chance at it.

551
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,199
Pick your best members, boys!

552
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,399
We lost them last time. But this time, we’ll win.

553
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,120
I know how to play this game now!

554
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,800
If you’re ready, jump on board.

555
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,580
No need to rush. Just take it slow.

556
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,580
White, move your feet a little.

557
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,320
Go left, go left.

558
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,139
Up, up.

559
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,420
It doesn’t look like Team B will be on equilibrium any time soon.

560
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,140
All they do is keep touching the ground.

561
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,200
A little to the left.

562
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,200
They look like sumo wrestlers.

563
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,200
Oi, watch your face.

564
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,220
ROOTING HARD.

565
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,940
Their longest record so far is one second. They could be in trouble.

566
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,320
Let’s just dance.

567
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,540
ENCOURAGING CHEERS.

568
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,240
Do your best!

569
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,419
One, two, three, four.

570
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,340
Their new record is four seconds. Looks like they’ve got the gist of it.

571
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,340
Heave ho, heave ho, boys!

572
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,939
Just a little. Slowly.

573
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,740
You’ve got the rhythm down, we don’t need to change players.

574
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,820
In one, two, three. To the left. Right. Left.

575
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,640
Stay on the left.

576
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,100
A LITTLE MORE.

577
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,920
One, two.

578
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,500
THEY’RE IN TROUBLE.
You’re getting there.

579
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,500
One, two.

580
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,820
Calm down.

581
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,200
One, Two.

582
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,360
Looks like they’re almost there.

583
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,380
Three, four, five.

584
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,100
Yay!

585
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,040
That wasn’t an easy feast for them at all.

586
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,760
They were curled up together on the plank, touching the floor left and right.

587
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,720
The other guys were kept on the tips of their toes rooting for Team B.

588
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,500
But now it’s time for Team C to play.

589
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,040
Go!

590
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,920
I’ll get on it first.

591
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,780
This team relies on their strength and their coordination.

592
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,260
Wait, you guys try to stay still.

593
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,400
It’s impossible. I’m 60kg in weight while he 66.

594
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,840
MISCALCULATION.
It’s impossible. I’m 60kg in weight while he 66.

595
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,800
MISCALCULATION.

596
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,400
I’ll handle the balance, you guys stay still.

597
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,200
One, two.

598
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,180
I didn’t stand like them. I turned this way.

599
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,980
One.

600
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,640
Sorry, Off.

601
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
One, two.

602
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,420
They started off so cool and balancing,

603
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,340
but now they keep rocking left and right. That isn’t so promising.

604
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,800
One, two, three.

605
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,000
That was three seconds down. They’re gonna make it.

606
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,220
Four.

607
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,360
Uh-oh, and they’re falling over. That was only one second short. Start over.

608
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,260
Do it again.

609
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,280
One, two, three, four.

610
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,120
Four seconds again. Can they do it this time?

611
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,480
Five.

612
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,400
And they did!

613
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
Good job.

614
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,800
That was beautifully done, Team C!

615
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,040
Their plan was better than their first try.

616
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,940
It might take a while to find their

617
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,580
equilibrium but it was smooth sailing from there.

618
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,480
Even after the count of five, they could still hold the plank off the ground for a few more seconds.

619
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,640
Good job!

620
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,180
Keep your eyes on us, children.

621
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,440
Don’t jinx it.

622
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,900
Adults aren’t flustered about this kinda thing.

623
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,980
IS THAT SO?
Still water runs deep.

624
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,540
Let’s row a boat. Row, row, row.

625
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,399
Only joking.

626
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,380
I’ve given my knowledge to the new generation.

627
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,960
Get on it.

628
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Okay. Slowly.

629
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,340
Team A is in position. With Nanon at the helm, there is no need for worry.

630
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,240
First, keep your feet together.

631
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,040
Gun, your feet, too.

632
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,280
Closer.
O		LOOKING FOR THE BALANCE.

633
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,879
One, two, three.

634
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,680
See that? Is history about to repeat itself?

635
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,360
Four, five.

636
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,959
Yay!

637
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
MORE CONFUSION.

638
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,260
Who did better? You or them?

639
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,320
The word “fluke” isn’t in our dictionary.

640
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,700
What’s their secret? The first try was quick enough, but they did even better this time.

641
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,240
This game really belongs to Team A.	They sure got everyone dumbfounded.

642
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,700
Maybe they should quit being rangers and have a career in a balancing competition.

643
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,740
It’s all about planning.

644
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,780
Other teams just go for it, but we discuss our strategy.

645
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,520
You can see we didn’t stand the same way they did.

646
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,460
They chose to face forward, but we balanced the weight on both sides,

647
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,360
and let the guy in the middle handle the rest.

648
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
We trust each other.

649
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,360
If you really paid attention, both times,

650
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,760
it was Nanon who controlled the balance.

651
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,220
We really gotta give it to him this time around.

652
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,660
RESPECT FOR NANON.
We really gotta give it to him this time around.

653
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,760
I knew we would win from the moment I picked my teammates.

654
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,820
You planned this?

655
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,180
IS THAT SO?
I knew it from the moment I picked you.

656
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,680
IS THAT SO?

657
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
You’re hogging the credits, dude.

658
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,760
Our team looks like we’ve got nothing up our sleeves.

659
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Can you guys be sure we’re not gonna lose today?

660
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,260
Of course.

661
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,160
I’m certain we won’t lose. But I can’t say we’ll win.

662
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Do you love this team?

663
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,100
I love this team.

664
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,400
That’s not what he said when we were picking teammates.

665
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,879
From this game, Team B and Team C receive four points each.

666
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
4 POINTS.

667
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,800
The MVP of this game, Team A, receives six points!

668
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,419
ALL TO THEMSELVES.

669
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,980
That was two games down and they’ve showcased their skills.

670
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,140
Now let’s look at their total scores.

671
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,460
Team A is in the lead with 11 points.

672
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,340
SO COOL.

673
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,959
Team C is not far behind with nine points.

674
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,659
NOT BAD.

675
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,080
Lastly is Team B with six points.

676
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,620
DO BETTER.
Lastly is Team B with six points.

677
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,479
That’s not so far behind.

678
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,120
What a great feeling it is that our team has a competition.

679
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,960
What do you mean “a competition”, Leo?

680
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,500
Not a single team could take us.

681
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,960
THEY’RE BRAGGING.

682
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,920
You know what, Team B and C could combine their points and still don’t come up to us.

683
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,000
And the teamwork game is over.

684
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,600
Some teams even tried to use maths to help them play.

685
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,020
And the results are just as you’ve seen it.

686
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,660
It is time to test their climbing skills in the next break.

687
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:24,540
Alright, the next game requires lower and upper body strengths and also knowledge.

688
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:32,399
Becoming a ranger really is full of obstacles, but otherwise they wouldn’t be the perfect rangers.

689
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,679
The next game is rock climbing!

690
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,760
EXCITED CHEERS.

691
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,480
And what you need to win this is bravery, confidence, and craziness.

692
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,160
Which Team has it all?

693
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,140
Our team.

694
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,940
Excuse you, P’Tay. Look at our builds.

695
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,680
Who’s got bravery?

696
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,100
Me. Everyone here.

697
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,580
We’re bold.

698
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,699
THEY DON’T LOOK THAT WAY.

699
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,320
It was dead quiet.

700
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,300
Yeah, we’re brave.

701
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,000
We are!

702
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,300
If you’re really brave then your team go first.

703
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,200
Mond, you go.

704
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
LIKE HE’S PLAYING HOT POTATO.

705
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,720
What if we’re afraid of height, can we climb it horizontally?

706
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,500
THAT’S TOO ADVANCED.

707
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,300
Honestly, I’m concerned for this team.

708
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,340
Why?

709
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,139
Well, they don’t look like they can make it.

710
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,040
No need to be concerned for us.

711
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
We’re definitely not gonna make it.

712
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,360
Oh, okay.

713
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,879
Hey.

714
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,439
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE.

715
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
You’d never know, right?

716
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,300
I’ll do it.

717
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
Really?

718
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,780
I’ll do it.

719
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,760
I did it once.

720
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,460
I’ve got deja vu.

721
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,800
I missed that time.

722
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,600
Can I just jump off? I’ve had enough with this. I’m scared!

723
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,399
But this time, it could work.

724
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,140
I’m not saying I can do it, I just gotta try.

725
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,440
Show them what we’ve got.

726
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,040
Of course.

727
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,800
What about you over there in Team A?

728
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,680
I’ll do it.

729
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,400
Don’t do it, Gun. I don’t want you getting tired.

730
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,160
First, you do it.

731
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,520
We gotta learn from our mistakes and our fears.

732
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,200
I’m afraid of heights but I’ll do it.

733
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,640
LET’S TRY!
I’m afraid of heights but I’ll do it.

734
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,660
LET’S TRY!

735
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,860
I’ll overcome my fear.

736
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,620
To victory.

737
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,360
Today, my team will come out on top.

738
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,199
Let’s say your fear was right in front of you. Overcome it.

739
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,740
Don’t wanna.

740
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,920
FAILURE.

741
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,500
Why do we need strength and power to win this game? Let’s see what the rules are.

742
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,240
The rules of the rock climbing game.

743
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,659
Each team sends in one player to climb the boulder to get to the clues.

744
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,379
Each time they reach a clue, the player reads the keyword out loud for their teammates.

745
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,700
After they get all the keywords, the player must come down to write the correct answer on the board.

746
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,060
The team with the best time record wins the game.

747
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,980
And that was the rules of the game.

748
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,000
Rock climbing needs lower body strength, do you guys have any?

749
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,320
Yeah!

750
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,960
Do you?

751
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,199
I’m about to fold over.

752
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,299
GET UP!

753
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,920
You have to put up a fearless look.

754
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,159
Let’s pretend we didn’t hear that.

755
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,259
P’Tay, you gotta be braver.

756
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,660
Act tough, P’Tay. Puff your chest.

757
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,420
THAT’S YOUR BRAVE FACE?

758
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,440
Adorable.

759
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,360
What about Team C, you got any strength in your legs?

760
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,920
Of course.

761
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,580
Excuse you, I do squats while carrying a 180kg weight on me.

762
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,000
I can do that, too, man. But I’ll black out.

763
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,500
HE SHOULD HAVE JUST STAYED QUIET!

764
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,700
Hey, listen to what my big brothers here can do.

765
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,339
What’s wrong, man?

766
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,140
He’s vexed.

767
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,900
CALM DOWN.

768
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,100
You said you carry, what, 180kg while squatting?

769
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,740
That’s nothing.

770
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,080
My brother here used to be a football player.

771
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,819
His lower body is mad strong.

772
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,680
He could break a ball with a kick.

773
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,200
TIME TO SHOW ’EM.

774
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,840
Oh, we’re so gonna win this.

775
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
He can get from here to up there in a leap.

776
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,420
WOW!

777
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,760
His kicks rival even those of Zlatan’s!

778
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,120
He could do 20 speed squats in a breath.

779
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,160
Don’t even mention step over, ’cause he sure can do.

780
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,820
KEEP GOING.

781
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
JUST SHUT YA TRAP ALREADY, BRO.

782
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,200
In other words, my team is very good.

783
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,379
VERY BELIEVABLE.

784
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,180
Now that we know the rules, who will be playing for your teams in the first round?

785
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,339
The first round is all about timing. The second round is English vocabulary.

786
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,540
For the first round, we’re sending our little hamster.

787
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,200
What about you guys in Team B?

788
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,980
Alright, I’ll go first.

789
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,200
I’ll take Gun down this round.

790
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
So we’re sending New.

791
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,240
Can we send Nicky, too?

792
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,819
To the hospital, that is.

793
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,000
HE PLAYED TOO MUCH.
I am heaving through my lungs.

794
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,420
Alright, let the game begin!

795
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Hey, don’t get too worked up.

796
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,020
Say something.

797
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,800
Well…

798
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah.

799
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,280
How fast will you go?

800
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,100
Not so fast because this is actually a bit scary.
He said he was scared.

801
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,120
From a distance, it doesn’t look tall. But standing right underneath it now, it is tall.

802
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,960
P’Gun is our only hope.

803
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,360
’Cause there’s no one else you can count on.

804
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,840
THAT WAS MEAN!

805
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,420
You’re underestimating us. We can still count on Leo.

806
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,740
Let’s switch places right now.

807
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,000
Don’t waste your time, man. Come back.

808
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,380
STAY PUT.

809
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,120
Gun wouldn’t give up his place, too. He scooted away from you just now.

810
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,140
Go, go.

811
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,400
Go slowly.

812
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,980
No need to rush, Gun. Go easy. Don’t listen to Leo.

813
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,900
Gun took no time to reach the first clue at all.

814
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,280
Amphawa.

815
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,800
Amphawa. We know that.

816
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,140
It’s in Chiang Rai?

817
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,020
It’s not.

818
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,080
Gun keeps on climbing.

819
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,720
It’s not in Suphanburi.

820
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,399
It’s in Samut Sakhon.

821
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,920
I know it.

822
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,740
In Samut Songkhram.

823
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,479
Mackerel.

824
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,620
Mackerel? From Mae Klong.

825
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,420
WHERE IS IT?

826
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,640
I know this, too.

827
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,040
Khlong Khon, what’s that?

828
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,300
Just get down here.

829
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,780
With his mini size, climbing isn’t his problem at all.

830
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,820
He was so fast to get to the clues which say, “Amphawa,” “mackerel,” and “Khlong Khon.”

831
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,680
What will be the answer Gun and his team come up with?

832
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,779
It’s Samut Sakhon.

833
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,500
How do you spell that?

834
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,880
S-M…

835
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,280
The whole team is helping him spell out the correct word.

836
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
T. Write T.

837
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,400
S-A-K-H-O-N.

838
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,520
Let’s ring the bell.

839
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,259
Oh, they got it wrong. Think again.

840
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,300
It’s Samut Songkhram.

841
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:22,420
S-O-N-G-K-H-R-A-M.

842
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,440
Okay!

843
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,640
Told you it wasn’t correct.

844
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,100
Mackerel from Khlong Khon?

845
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,680
Mackerel from Khlong khon and Amphawa.

846
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
From Mae Klong, mostly.

847
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,020
Was it tiring climbing up there?

848
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,840
Yeah. It took a lot of energy. My legs are burning right now.

849
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,040
It kinda felt slippery when I was climbing.

850
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,600
Could you guess the answer while you were climbing?

851
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,480
Not at all. I didn’t even think about it, only read it aloud.

852
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,240
I was only aiming to get up there as fast as I could, hoping the team would take care of the rest.

853
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,020
Was it difficult? If you’re not afraid, then it’s not supposed to be.

854
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,380
Hey, White. I’ve got high hopes for you. I hope you’ll do great in this game.

855
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,120
You’ll get to the top.

856
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,160
Hey, White. I’ve got high hopes for you. I hope you’ll do great in this game.

857
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
For rock climbing?

858
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,000
Of course.

859
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,040
If I’d be climbing up anywhere, it’d be right behind you all.

860
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,560
Let’s climb together, then.

861
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,320
Just like that.

862
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,460
One step at a time.

863
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,120
He’s getting further from the ground.

864
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,120
Don’t fret the heights.

865
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,800
SOMETHING FLEW BY.

866
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,560
It broke off.

867
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,320
It seems White has lost his balance.

868
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,620
It’s alright.

869
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,540
Stay calm.

870
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,140
Football field.

871
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,400
Keep climbing, White.

872
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,380
Could it be Buriram?

873
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,060
Could be.

874
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060
Is it, though?

875
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,259
Wait for the next clues.

876
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,080
Muangthong.

877
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,299
Oi, football fields are common in every freaking province.

878
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,740
White suddenly slipped off. What matters now is if he can remain focused and keep going.

879
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,319
It’s alright, White.
EVERYONE IS ROOTING.

880
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,340
You can keep going.
It’s alright, White.
EVERYONE IS ROOTING.

881
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,900
You can keep going.

882
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,240
You’re doing amazing.

883
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,240
It’s okay. Keep going.

884
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,299
White, stay strong. Stay strong!

885
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,780
Keep holding on, White. You’ll get there soon.

886
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,000
You can do it.

887
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,440
ENCOURAGEMENTS KEEP POURING.

888
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,820
DETERMINED.

889
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,820
You can!

890
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,520
Do it!

891
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,060
You can!

892
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,279
Do it!

893
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,440
You can!

894
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,140
Do it!

895
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,180
You can!

896
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,600
Do it!

897
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,620
Prasart Phanom Rung.

898
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,980
It’s Buriram!

899
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,840
Keep going.

900
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,160
Get the next one and jump off.

901
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,460
Meatballs.

902
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Get down here.

903
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,740
Just let go.

904
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,180
Although the climb was rocky and slippery for White,

905
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,640
but with his determination, he got all the clues that say, “football field,” “Prasart Phanom Rung,” and “meatballs.”

906
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,400
Let’s see what their answer is.

907
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:49,860
Quickly.

908
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,160
The climb was rough for him from start to finish.

909
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,700
But now he’s got a pen in his hand and it’s time to write his answer.

910
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,200
B-U-R-I-R-A-M.

911
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,939
Ring it.

912
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,780
Football field.

913
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
There’s a football club, Buriram United.

914
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,960
Buriram United.

915
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,380
Prasart Phanom Rung, the famous historical place.

916
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,280
And lastly, meatballs.

917
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,500
It’s Lisa’s favourite snack from her hometown.

918
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,640
GOOD JOB!

919
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,400
And so the answer is…

920
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,280
Buriram!

921
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,940
How was it, facing your defeated fear?

922
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,560
It was challenging, not easy at all.

923
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,120
My grips weren’t strong enough to hold on.

924
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,920
Of course I felt a little shaken since it wasn’t something I’m used to.

925
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,780
But compared to last time…

926
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,480
You did much better.

927
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,520
Last time, White gave up after he slipped.

928
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,100
But this time, he kept pushing forward.

929
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
When you slipped, were you scared?

930
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,120
Did you realise there was a safety line on you?

931
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
I knew it was safe, but it gave me a fright anyway.

932
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,160
I have never done rock climbing in my entire life. This is my first time.

933
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,259
REALLY?
I have never done rock climbing in my entire life. This is my first time.

934
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,840
REALLY?

935
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,200
Are you joking?
I have really never tried.

936
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,960
But I saw a photo of you rock climbing, P’New?

937
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,480
He was just lying. He’s good at it.

938
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,180
I’m scared, really.

939
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,859
Do you even have any strength, New?

940
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,780
Not really.

941
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,860
New’s good. I’ve seen him climb.

942
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,880
You can do it, P’New.

943
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,859
New proceeds nimbly upward.

944
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,020
How could he just do that?

945
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,880
Looks difficult.

946
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,420
Mon Bridge.

947
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,100
That’s in Kanchanaburi.

948
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,540
That was one clue down. He’s heading towards the next.

949
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,180
It’s in Tak.

950
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,759
Or Chanthaburi?

951
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,240
Erawan Falls.

952
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,879
Maybe Nakhon Nayok?

953
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,460
Khwae Noi River.

954
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,600
That was three clues down very easily.

955
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,680
He was very agile.

956
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,960
And the clues are “Mon Bridge,” “Erawan Falls,” and “Khwae Noi River.”

957
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
What province would that be, Team C?

958
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,860
K-A-N.

959
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,020
C-H-A-N-A.

960
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,859
And Buri.

961
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,420
Ring it.

962
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,480
Well done.

963
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,140
He was so quick.

964
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,400
What are the clues again?

965
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,520
First, Mon Bridge.

966
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,180
Then, Erawan Falls.

967
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,940
And lastly…

968
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,460
Khwae Noi River.

969
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,359
How was this week’s episode?

970
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,700
That was two missions down for our new rangers.

971
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,259
The first game was a feast of height and speed,

972
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,040
and Team A and C sent their strongest rangers to conquer it.

973
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,700
No wonder the two teams won that game and got a head start.

974
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,899
The second game was all about balance,

975
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,700
with Team A easily snatching the first place.

976
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,919
Even with different players on the plank, it was still smooth sailing for Team A.

977
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,100
We really gotta give it to them.

978
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,400
We can say that practice really makes perfect.

979
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:54,260
Special thanks to the location for this training camp for our rangers at The Verona at Thap Lan in Prachinburi.

980
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:00,580
It is only a few hours away from Bangkok and it’s got great weather and great hotels.

981
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:07,660
A perfect trip for families and anyone adventurous, since they’ve got all these fun obstacle games.

982
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:13,160
There is also a beautiful garden for photography enthusiasts, too. Thank you for the hospitality.

983
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,360
Next week, we’re still here with our special episodes: Intro to Rangers.

984
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,880
It takes more than willpower to become the perfect rangers.

985
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,480
Stay tuned and root for the last team’s rock climbing challenge and another mission which tests who’s a great shot.

986
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:35,920
Lastly, it is time to push them to their limits to see who’s actually got the guts.

987
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,000
We will see you in seven days. Good day!
