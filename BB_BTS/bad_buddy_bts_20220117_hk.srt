[OHM’S NEW TOY.]

3
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:25,983
[IT’S A NEW SONG. LET HIM REHEARSE IT FIRST.]
♪ Is love a beautiful world? ♪

4
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:30,290
♪ Something of grandeur ♪

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,501
♪ Is it a sky, a mountain, a sea, or other kind of splendor? ♪

6
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,839
♪ Just a love song that you… ♪

7
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:44,004
[WHAT ARE THE LYRICS AGAIN?]

8
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,003
Sometimes, I forget. You know?

9
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:52,311
WE MUST WELCOME THE NEW SONG WITH A BEAUTIFUL SCENE.

10
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,650
♪ There are no perfect… ♪

11
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,480
♪ There are no perfect sweet… ♪

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,845
[HE FORGETS THE CHORDS TOO.]
And now I’m forgetting the chords.

13
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,494
[SORRY. IT’S THE FIRST REHEARSAL OF THE SONG.]

14
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:08,403
♪ There are no perfect sweet words ♪

15
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:15,000
♪ Love is nothing else but you ♪

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,851
Staff: You basically sing to the audience?

17
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:18,577
Yes, to end the episode beautifully.

18
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,254
Everyone will get to hear a very good song.

19
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,200
Staff: What is the song called?

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,192
It’s called Our Song (The Song I Just Finished Composing).
Staff: Really?

21
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,297
Staff: You just finished it?

22
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:26,484
Just now.

23
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:27,640
What a genius* (Genius = Achariya).

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,914
I’m not talking about myself.

25
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,954
[THANK YOU FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG, P’AMP.]
I meant P’Amp Achariya, the composer.

[THAT’S A VERY NICE SONG.]

32
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,748
Okay. Cut!

33
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:07,090
I didn’t know how you’re playing this scene.

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,513
[SOMEONE IS WHINING NOW.]
I didn’t either. I didn’t see you.

35
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,773
I really had no idea how you portrayed it.

36
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:12,490
Me neither.

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,836
How did you play it?

38
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:16,385
I don’t know. I just played the song.

39
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:21,332
I was crying at the end.
[OHM MAKES IT VERY TOUCHING.]

40
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:24,186
It’s going to be the most impressive scene for me.

41
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,854
Turn the camera that way, please.

42
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,220
[OHM WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED.]
And that was my seat.

43
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,613
Nanon was right there.

44
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,613
It was a very emotional scene.

45
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:35,603
Everything will be told in episode 11.

46
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:39,786
And we must link and connect the emotions.

47
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,682
But we didn’t get to see each other’s faces.
[P’YO IS SAYING THEY’RE PROFESSIONALS.]

48
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,915
I designed the act differently.

49
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,595
Whatever I felt during the song, I portrayed it that way.

50
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:47,075
And he acted his own way too.

51
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,988
I don’t know how they’re going to edit it

52
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,095
but P’Aof said we’re done filming for today.

53
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:54,172
Let’s see how it’s going to turn out.

54
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:57,998
I’m sure it will be one of the most impressive scenes.

55
00:02:57,998 --> 00:02:58,944
I didn’t see you.

56
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,417
So I thought I’d think of all the flashbacks we had together.

57
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:03,581
I felt fulfilled.

58
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,131
Let’s see what P’Aof says.

59
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,715
Wait until they clear off this set.

60
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:09,062
Let’s go see him now.

61
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,062
It’s such a miracle.

62
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:14,262
They played it all from their imagination.

63
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,625
They were separated by a black partition.

64
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,691
But they did great.

65
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:21,135
P’Aof, was it really okay?
[HE’S STILL CURIOUS.]

66
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:21,635
What?

67
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,808
He was crying. Did I choose the right way to play it?

68
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:28,505
I do know how I’m going to edit the scene.

69
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:31,396
I just didn’t realize you wouldn’t get to see each other at all.

70
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,065
[THEY’RE TOTALLY BLOCKED.]
That black thing separated us.

71
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:35,451
Stay tuned, guys. You’ll love it.

72
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:38,141
Well, Pran was singing for his boyfriend.
Right.

73
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,311
This is P’Aof’s signature.

74
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,185
He did it before with P’Med scene (He’s Coming To Me).

75
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:42,685
Ohm played the whole scene by himself.

76
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:43,353
Exactly.

77
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:47,685
We’ll see how this one is going to turn out.

78
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,000
Have you ever watched The Wall Song?

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,131
They have to convey and link their feeling through the wall.

80
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,216
- Using their voices?
- Right.

81
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,751
Let’s see if we gave the right answer.

82
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:59,328
When you’re done here, go massage the guests over there.

83
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:01,177
They need foot massages.
[THE UNIFORM IS JUST RIGHT!]

84
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,765
Staff: Can you please take off the mic while giving an interview?

85
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:04,339
Of course!
