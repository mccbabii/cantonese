1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,397
IT’S RAINING (HEAVILY) ON THE LAST DAY OF FILMING.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,728
OK. Cut!

3
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:20,246
The slate, please. I need two claps.

4
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:22,172
We’re doing a close-up shot, right?

5
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,360
Right.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,277
I’m having goosebumps.

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:28,511
It was full of emotions.

8
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:32,564
It was somehow weird to see two of my friends kissing.
[NOT USED TO SEEING THAT.]

9
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,164
I was so into it

10
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,149
and having chills at the same time.

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,170
I like it though, the last scene.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,880
The emotions were so on point.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,812
[THE RAIN IS POURING AGAIN.]

14
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:47,419
Staff: It’s pouring.

15
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:51,276
Staff: What are you going to do, Mr. Director?

16
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:56,707
Well, we flew kites in the rain before.

17
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,514
But we can’t kiss in the rain here.
[TOO HEAVILY!]

18
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:00,860
We just can’t.

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,515
Staff: Hi, guys.

20
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:04,800
Staff: What time is it now?

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:13,193
I don’t know. I have nothing to say.
[SO MANY PROBLEMS!]

22
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:15,907
It’s 2:28 am right now.

23
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:20,211
And what’s happening is…

24
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:23,105
It’s been raining since 11 pm.

25
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,285
It’s been 3-4 hours now,

26
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,298
and there are 4 scenes altogether that have been adjusted to the new direction.

27
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,871
They were turned into indoor scenes.

28
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,901
The rain hasn’t stopped.

29
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,678
All we can do is pray.

30
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,997
Please stop. We need to continue filming with a nicer atmosphere.

31
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,590
Staff: And it’s a very important scene for today.
Right.

32
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,182
We only have 2 scenes left here.
[ONLY TWO AND WE’LL BE DONE!]

33
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:48,480
And everyone will get to go home and rest peacefully.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,980
Then we can proudly say we’re done filming.

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:56,702
You can rain as much as you want but can I please get the kiss scene…

36
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:57,942
Finished?
Yes!

37
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:01,356
Or you can rain the second half because that last scene is more flexible.

38
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,862
But we can’t kiss in the rain, seriously.

39
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,179
Please. I’m begging you.

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,180
[THE RAIN HAS STOPPED.]

41
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:14,933
Nanon, you’re repeating the lines, right?

42
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,678
Yes, to wake myself up.
[NANON, YOU JUST TOOK A NAP, RIGHT?]

43
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,678
I’m so ready!

44
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:43,324
Cut.

45
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:57,302
[HE’S STILL CRYING SO HARD.]

46
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,567
Can I get some tissue papers, please?

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,831
I’m here to support my friends.

48
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,629
There are lots of obstacles filming this scene.

49
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:18,019
The rain, the sleepiness, everything.

50
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,733
But I do believe that Ohm and Nanon can pull it off.
Right.

51
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:26,416
All the obstacles are here to test us.

52
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,922
To make us do better.

53
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,385
Staff: The whole crew has been tested today.
Exactly!

54
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,283
But it’s specialness.

55
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:36,283
Don’t blackout yet.

56
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,316
It’s special…it’s late, right? You’re sleepy.

57
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,317
I am.

58
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,317
It is very special.

59
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:45,821
Shh! They’re starting now.

60
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:56,361
There was something that we don’t need, like the tears.

61
00:03:56,361 --> 00:04:00,266
But I do understand the emotions you had there.
[P’AOF DOESN’T WANT THE TEARS.]

62
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:03,529
But the character Pat didn’t need that.

63
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:04,384
The tears.

64
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,373
That’s the problem.

65
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,834
I was giving him choices in just case.
[IN CASE P’AOF NEEDS IT LATER.]

66
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,359
No, I’m serious.

67
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,359
In case you want it.

68
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,294
Kiss scene at 4 am.

69
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:20,000
To be honest, having to wait to film affected my mood.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,373
I could concentrate more.

71
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:24,591
Right, you got to rest for a bit.
That too.

72
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:26,591
No, I didn’t get to rest but…

73
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:32,486
it dragged me deep into concentration.

74
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:36,568
I felt like I really needed to finish the shooting.

75
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,738
But at the very beginning, I just wanted to party.

76
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:47,608
‘I’m going to find a better hero for the play.’

77
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:52,657
‘I’m done asking you.’
[THE LAST SCENE, EVERYONE.]

78
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:03,455
Cut.

79
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,260
Ohm and Nanon, come here at the monitors.

80
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,629
I’m here.

81
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,763
Ohm.

82
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:22,381
I’ll let you say ‘The filming is done.’

83
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:24,647
Here. The filming is done, buddy!

84
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:25,519
What?

85
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,519
The filming is done, buddy.

86
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,519
The filming is done, buddy!!

87
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,833
I thought he was going to brief us on something.

88
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,833
Exactly. I thought the same.

89
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:43,080
Great job.

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,977
Thank you.

91
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,892
Thank you, Nanon.

92
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:46,223
Thank you, Ohm.

93
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:48,223
[LET’S GO BACK BEFORE THE RAIN.]

94
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,851
This is the last day of filming.
[LET’S GO GET SOME PICTURES.]

95
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,450
I’m just playing around.

96
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,989
Staff: Who else is here tonight?

97
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:55,798
Everyone who works on this series,

98
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,382
including those who finished their scenes earlier. Let’s go take

99
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,382
some pictures of the last day, guys.

100
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:03,406
Hi.

101
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,597
He’s even wearing a suit.

102
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,153
Do you like men in suits?

103
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,352
You look better without it.

104
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:10,000
I’m just kidding.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,429
I asked Prom once what he’d wear on the last day of filming.

106
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:20,517
I teased him that he’d be wearing Gucci or brand name stuff all over.
[NANON, HE’S SUCH A TEASE.]

107
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:21,849
Just like I said.

108
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,206
Louise Vuitton sandals.

109
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,998
Pants from Chanel.

110
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:27,582
T-shirt from Chanel.

111
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:28,928
And the suit?

112
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:29,813
Borrowed.

113
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:32,647
[THE JOKE ENDS HERE.]

114
00:06:35,506 --> 00:06:37,506
Let’s say hey!

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,915
The filming is done, buddy!!

116
00:06:53,923 --> 00:07:01,190
“So grateful to everyone who has always been supportive. Every piece of feedback, complaint, and compliment is much appreciated. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Until we meet again, buddy. - P’Aof, The Director.”

117
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,950
