大家好，歡迎嚟到 Arm Share

00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:22,556
今集好特別

5
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,998
因為我哋嚟到好有愛嘅一個月

6
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:26,630
好似噉咁有愛

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,909
喺呢個咁正嘅moment

8
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:30,817
我邀請咗2位我好中意嘅弟弟上嚟

9
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:34,955
These two are lovey-dovey. They give us butterflies.

10
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:38,833
所以我想叫佢哋喺呢個咁特別嘅月份

11
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,902
We’ll have a mission for them too.

12
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:43,072
Before we get to the mission,

13
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:45,072
let’s meet them,

14
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,871
my beloved juniors–Ohm, Nanon.

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,385
Nanon, Ohm.

16
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:50,461
Sawasdee krub.

17
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:53,861
I called you in today because it’s a special occasion.

18
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:56,336
We are in the month of love, February.

19
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:57,760
So we have a couple…

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,007
from Bad Buddy Series that has just ended.

21
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:01,650
Yes.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,013
It was very well received.

23
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:04,507
Thank you.

24
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,344
Tell us how you feel? You may thank your fans.

25
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:09,423
We are grateful to everyone who watches the series.

26
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:11,709
We feel that the hard work has paid off.

27
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,440
The dedication we put in over the past year has paid off.

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,926
Thank you very much for watching and giving us feedback,

29
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:17,435
and for loving this series.

30
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:19,191
We feel really happy.

31
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,565
Thank you so much.

32
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:23,077
Ohm agreed with everything his friend said.

33
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,117
That’s right.

34
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,951
Today, I have a mission for you two.

35
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:27,812
Okay.

36
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:29,479
It’s called the Secret Mission of Love.

37
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,528
I’m not gonna reveal it yet.

38
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:33,735
Tell you what? I have done many jobs before this.

39
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:35,115
And I’m a bit hungry right now.

40
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:36,320
An army marches on its stomach.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,050
Right.

42
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,157
May I grab something to eat?

43
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:39,818
I’ve just looked at what I want to have.

44
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:41,550
You are hungry too, right?

45
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,663
And now, we are at The Baker.

46
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:47,368
The Baker is a premium bakery shop

47
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,678
located in Tops Market and Central Food Hall.

48
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:55,439
And its bakery products are Artisan bakeries.

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,502
They are just like homemade bakeries,

50
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,942
which are freshly baked and made with premium ingredients from around the world.

51
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:04,192
So the bakery products here have the taste and texture like those

52
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,792
from a premium bakery shop but at affordable prices.

53
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,986
These are European bakeries with an Asian twist.

54
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,581
Besides the great taste and quality ingredients,

55
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:15,173
they have Master Baker

56
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:19,128
who is a specialist with years of experience in baking.

57
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,760
Let me ask you this.

58
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,017
Do you two like bakeries?

59
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,333
Not so much.

60
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:28,119
MORE LIKE VERY MUCH HUNGRY

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,480
Just sometimes. I like to eat them when I have a chance to.

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,728
Is it good?

63
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,113
Yes. / Very much.

64
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,490
Let me tell you that the baked goods here at The Baker,

65
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,877
its Master Baker creates many types of baked goods that are fascinating

66
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:45,818
as he likes to pick up the trends from around the world to his creations.

67
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:50,101
His signatures with unique recipes are croissants and brioches.

68
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,629
Brioche is this one.

69
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:53,590
- This?
- Yes.

70
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,252
What is Brioche?

71
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:58,545
What is Brioche? I have someone who can give you an answer.

72
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,655
I don’t have specific knowledge of baking.

73
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:03,831
I have Master Baker who will tell you what Brioche is.

74
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,072
Let’s meet Master Baker.

75
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:08,161
All right.

76
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:10,244
And this is our Master Baker.

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I have a question.

78
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,088
What is Brioche?

79
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,204
But there are many flavors in Brioche, right?

80
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,037
What flavor is this one?

81
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,244
This is Truffle Brioche.

82
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,430
Truffle?

83
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,658
Truffle from Italy.

84
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,565
There are many types here.

85
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:13,563
Let me sum up all the flavors they have.

86
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:17,132
This one is Candied Pecan Longan Honey Brioche.

87
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,745
It’s Brioche with Pecan and honey from longan flower.

88
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:25,864
And that one is Black Truffle.

89
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,193
And this one is French Butter Artisan Brioche.

90
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,787
These are the 3 favorite flavors from this bakery.

91
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,621
During this month of love,

92
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:38,804
Master Baker has created special baked products for Valentine's Day specifically.

93
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,119
It’s called Sweet Valentine L’Amour.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,682
All the names are in Valentine's series.

95
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,695
All the names are in Valentine's series.

96
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:13,803
They sound yum.

97
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,164
There are 5 types in the series.

98
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:18,229
All right, Master Baker has introduced his bakeries.

99
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:20,106
You two are hungry.

100
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,106
Why don’t you browse around and pick your favorites?

101
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:24,597
After that, I’ll bring you to the upper floor.

102
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:28,267
You two will have to create a special bakery.

103
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:30,229
You will get to learn it.

104
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,765
But now, I’ll let you choose your bakeries.

105
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:32,906
Can I have a croissant?

106
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:33,864
I’m gonna have this one.

107
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:34,628
Thank you.

108
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,921
Right now, we have chocolate and stuff for garnishing.

109
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,585
The creation today is…

110
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:02,619
Valentine L’Amour Chocolate Box from The Baker.

111
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:05,142
As you can see, there’s one finished product here.

112
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:05,781
I want to make one too.

113
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,192
But we don’t know how to decorate this yet.

114
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,510
Let Master Baker show us how to do it.

115
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,423
All right.

116
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,359
Please come in, Master Baker.

117
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,798
Hello again.

118
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,016
Sawasdee krub.

119
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,719
So L’amour means ‘Kwam Rak’.

120
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:56,858
Kwam Rak.

121
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,521
Let’s continue.

122
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:00,274
Okay. I’ll show you.

123
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,596
He’s drawing a heart over a heart-shaped cookie.

124
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:33,879
Next step is choosing the ingredients over here to decorate.

125
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,817
How did you do it, Ohm? Show it to the camera.

126
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,579
Right now, we are using 2 colors of chocolate icing to draw on the heart cookies.

127
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,294
and use them to decorate the chocolate box.

128
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,965
Have you two ever done something like this together?

129
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,455
No.

130
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,810
But I used to bake.

131
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,776
Really? You did it on your own account or for a show.

132
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,286
I did it on my own account.

133
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,836
Really? For what occasion?

134
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,087
For a birthday.

135
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,895
Okay. I’ve finished. I’m gonna put them in this.

136
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:23,794
In this chocolate box.

137
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:29,016
I have finished mine too. There are 5 pieces of cookies.

138
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,867
How is it going, Nanon?

139
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,989
It’s going well. I have finished 5 pieces.

140
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,073
Yeah!

141
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:48,939
Right now, the three of us have decorated these special chocolate items

142
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,052
made for Valentine’s Day.

143
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,090
And we have Master Baker to help us here.

144
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,893
Now, we will ask Master Baker to rate our work.

145
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:00,413
Let’s see how many scores we get.

146
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,406
Okay, Master Baker.

147
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:04,928
Give me the points from 1-10.

148
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,382
This one is mine.

149
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,758
6? Okay.

150
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:19,441
Give me more, please. Give me more.

151
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,234
No.

152
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:23,785
He’s so strict.

153
00:09:23,785 --> 00:09:24,711
I wanna cry.

154
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,075
Okay, I got 6 points.

155
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,196
And this one?

156
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,807
6? Same score.

157
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:39,193
Last one.

158
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,919
Okay.

159
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,434
Arm got 6, Nanon got 6, and Ohm got 7 points.

160
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:53,451
All right. Thank you, Master Baker, for showing us how to make

161
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:56,285
and decorate these chocolate boxes.

162
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,524
Thank you so much.

163
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:58,696
Kids, thank Master Baker.

164
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:01,185
Thank you.

165
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,668
And these are the 3 Valentine’s L’Amour Chocolate Boxes from us.

166
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,566
Let’s check them out now.

167
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,991
This one is made by Ohm.

168
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,513
Why is there “NNN” inside the heart?

169
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:13,480
I made two pieces for Nanon.

170
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,793
There are several layers.

171
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,152
NNN is Nanon’s name.

172
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,369
Blue is the color of the Chelsea jersey.

173
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,543
Look, there’s Chelsea on this side. 
Nanon likes Chelsea football club.

174
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:23,742
No.1 is the number of a goalkeeper.

175
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:25,562
The goalkeeper who gets No.1 is an excellent goalkeeper.

176
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:27,680
It’s Nanon’s favorite position in football.

177
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,657
Yes.

178
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:32,136
There are several layers to represent how good Nanon is at saving goals.

179
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,391
It has deep meaning.

180
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,218
And what is that?

181
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,603
I tried…

182
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,742
Joker?

183
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,245
I tried to draw Joker.

184
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,740
But it’s not close to it.

185
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,133
I made this to have the feel of a cartoon.

186
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,802
It looks like his face.

187
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,839
Big eyes with a cute tiny nose,

188
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,678
there it goes. It’s inside his mouth now.

189
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:57,102
As for my creation, I don’t have anyone so I made this for Arm Share.

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,818
For Arm Share fans.

191
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:02,669
Yes, for the fans of my show. Inside the box is my name.

192
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,992
And the word ‘Love’ here, so it is

193
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:07,942
Arm Love Arm Share.

194
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,465
We have finished our special sweet creations.

195
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:18,125
If you are looking for a special sweet bakery for Valentine’s Day,

196
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:23,715
come to The Baker between February 2 and 15.

197
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:26,408
This place can give you an experience that is beyond

198
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,461
and bring you premium delicacy at a good price.

199
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:34,652
It’s so convenient to shop at Tops Market and Central Food Hall

200
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,328
through 60 branches as well as online platforms,

201
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:42,309
www.tops.co.th and Grab application via GrabFood.

202
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,506
Not just that,

203
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:50,010
The Baker Thailand has another fun activity with Ohm and Nanon in this month of love.

204
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,893
When you buy any products from The Baker,

205
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:56,234
you’ll get a chance to win a video call with Ohm and Nanon.

206
00:11:56,234 --> 00:12:00,948
See more details on how to join this activity on The Baker Thailand Facebook.

207
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:06,899
But today’s activity is not just making these chocolate boxes.

208
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,271
We have another mission which I already gave you homework.

209
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,532
If you have to dress each other

210
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,374
to look like a character from romantic movies,

211
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:17,251
which character do you like to dress your partner?

212
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:18,000
All right.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,071
Have you picked a character yet?

214
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,571
I have.

215
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,485
Submit your homework to me now. What character do you want for Ohm ?

216
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,894
I want to dress Ohm as “Jack Dawson” from Titanic.

217
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,724
And what character do you give to Nanon?

218
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,190
I want him to be “Denchai” from Fan Day (One Day).

219
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,780
Okay. You did your homework. Very good.

220
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,251
Next, let’s go shopping and dress each other to the characters you have picked.

221
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:36,646
Let’s go.

222
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,089
Like I said I have a mission for you to do.

223
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:50,031
I want you to dress each other to a character in a romantic movie.

224
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,733
Why do you want to dress him as Jack Dawson?

225
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,790
I want him to drown to death.

226
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,112
Kidding.

227
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,550
- They are the Betadine Couple indeed.
- I don’t need to wear anything for that.

228
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:02,087
No. I feel that they share many of the same characteristics.

229
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,797
Jack in Titanic is bold and daring.

230
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:07,610
Jack wins a poker game, gets a Titanic ticket and jumps on the ship right away.

231
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,847
Once he sees the woman he likes, he just approaches her right away.

232
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,324
Ohm is like Jack in the movie.

233
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:15,733
If he’s Jack, then you have to pose in the nude for him to draw a sketch.

234
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,954
What do you want to dress him to?

235
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:29,268
Denchai from Fan Day.

236
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,420
Why?

237
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,211
Firstly, it’s a Thai film.

238
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,212
Secondly, Denchai cherishes love.

239
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,913
He can do anything for love.

240
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:39,366
Even though it’s wrong, he’s willing to do it.

241
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:40,961
Does he cherish you?

242
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:41,813
Hardly.

243
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:42,617
Show me.

244
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,891
What?

245
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:47,280
Don’t hurt him.

246
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,762
They are just teasing. It’s not that serious.

247
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,416
If you slap lightly on the skin, it’s not hurtful.

248
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,748
But if you slap with full force, it is hurtful.

249
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,084
That slap is just loud.

250
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,222
Earlier is just…

251
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:56,722
loud.

252
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:57,885
Just a sound.

253
00:13:57,885 --> 00:13:59,026
Just on the surface.

254
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,339
But this…

255
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,461
No need to.

256
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:03,908
I brought you to Zara.

257
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:08,174
Please go shopping and find the clothes that match the character you chose.

258
00:14:08,174 --> 00:14:08,752
Okay.

259
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:10,072
You can start browsing.

260
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:11,867
Take your time. Go.

261
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,157
Try wrapping around his neck and see if it works.

262
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:20,051
It works.

263
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:23,354
After this, we’ll take Nanon to get his hair permed to look like Denchai.

264
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:24,823
Do we need to go that far?

265
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:34,241
Assemble all pieces together and see how it goes.

266
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,496
1 outfit

267
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,809
Okay. How is Jack’s outfit going?

268
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:39,524
This is yours.

269
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:40,690
Just these two for Jack.

270
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,368
Jack will look like this.

271
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,370
Just add white suspenders then you are good to go.

272
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,962
And a white Tee.

273
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:46,285
A white Tee inside.

274
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,997
Try to place them on Denchai.

275
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,846
What about the top? Overcoat?

276
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:52,768
Topless.

277
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,161
No. I’m still looking for it. I haven’t found the one I like yet.

278
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,369
Apart from an overcoat, what is the inside layer?

279
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,086
A red shirt. I’m gonna pick that one, then.

280
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:00,413
Which one?

281
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:07,999
The problem is the outfit that Nanon has picked for Jack

282
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:09,608
has only 1 pair of pants left.

283
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,608
And the waist size is too large.

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,057
What is Ohm’s pants size?

285
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:15,270
Around 30

286
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,558
30 or 28.

287
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,461
28? He has such a tiny waist.

288
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,358
So you get only one?

289
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,096
Oh, there’s also a red shirt.

290
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,860
Yes. The red shirt.

291
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,013
Okay. Let’s pay for these first and go to another store.

292
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:33,643
All right. Let’s continue here, youngsters.

293
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:36,347
We haven’t gotten all the items we want yet.

294
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:38,384
We are now at PULL & BEAR.

295
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:40,076
You may continue.

296
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:41,077
Okay.

297
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:42,890
Hey.

298
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,481
Oh, he found it.

299
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:46,848
Camera, please zoom in to me.

300
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:49,295
Earlier, we called him here, right?

301
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,977
As he walked to here and waited for the cue,

302
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:54,119
he went, “Hey, this one works.”

303
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,613
“Yes. This is it.”

304
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:57,821
“Wait. Let them give us the cue first.”

305
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:59,332
What he acted earlier was so fake.

306
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,718
No, it was pretty smooth.

307
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,299
Was that smooth?

308
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,699
He did it smoothly. He was like…rolling eyes.

309
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:06,656
“Hey!”

310
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,781
I had an acting class.

311
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,578
Aof Nopphanarch’s pupil.

312
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:14,544
This one is perfect. I’m taking this one.

313
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:15,626
Great.

314
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,292
Get the correct size for Nanon.

315
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,317
XL?

316
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:19,974
It should be oversize. I want XXL.

317
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:21,022
XXL?

318
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,401
I’m gonna look for a shirt.

319
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,353
Instead of an overcoat. I’ll pick this one.

320
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,274
Ohm, what’s your pants size?

321
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,827
30

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,196
30?

323
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,708
I got these eyeglasses.

324
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:42,153
Denchai in the reference picture wears clear glasses.

325
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:44,019
But these are fashion glasses.

326
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,452
Nanon as Denchai is fashionable.

327
00:16:53,685 --> 00:17:00,000
The boys have got outfits that match the characters in the movies they chose.

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,464
We are going to see

329
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:06,477
if the reference pictures we have and the outfits they bought

330
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:07,888
are similar or not.

331
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,185
How cute will they be?

332
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:10,588
I’ll take you to see them upstairs.

333
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:15,441
And right now, we are going to show you the main lead from Fan Day (One Day).

334
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,520
This is Denchai from the movie.

335
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,431
Let’s check out together if he looks like Denchai, a role of Ter Chantavit.

336
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,663
Please give it up for Denchai from Fan Day.

337
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
Ooh. It’s pretty cold, huh?

338
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,970
It’s freezing.

339
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,028
It’s freezing. Are you in a cold city?

340
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,003
As if I were in Hokkaido.

341
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:49,251
And this is Denchai from Fan Day.

342
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:53,870
It’s the character Ohm picked for Nanon to portray.

343
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:55,534
How do you feel?

344
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,924
I feel why the hell he picked this outfit for me.

345
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:02,167
While I chose a cool look for him.

346
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:06,589
How many percent do you think you look like Ter Chantavit?

347
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:09,533
Insert the reference picture on this side.

348
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,907
Next.

349
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:18,906
We have Jack from Titanic.

350
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:22,400
Let’s see if this interpretation of Jack can make Rose fall for him.

351
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,265
Let’s meet our Jack.

352
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,198
Why do you have to put on a cool face? I’m seriously curious.

353
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,903
Doesn’t it make you blush when he does that?

354
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:43,408
Hi, Jack.

355
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:44,586
Yo.

356
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,306
There’s “Yo” too.

357
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,457
What’s with the “Yo”? That’s not it.

358
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:49,939
Go talk to Jack.

359
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,680
Hello.

360
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,101
Sawasdee krub.

361
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Oh, okay. Sawasdee krub.

362
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,132
What time in Thailand?

363
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,725
Do this. Like this.

364
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,322
My ship…

365
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,786
My ship has sailed.

366
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,495
And it’s Titanic too.

367
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,045
You got to dress as Jack picked by Nanon.

368
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,239
How do you feel?

369
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,590
At first, I didn’t think I could pull this off.

370
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,457
I thought it would be Oh!

371
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,491
You did. You actually pulled off this outfit.

372
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,726
Honestly. I picked his outfit too well.

373
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:26,938
He looks great on this.

374
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:27,656
He does.

375
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:28,952
Just like the handsome Jack Dawson.

376
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:29,708
Seriously.

377
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,515
He looks good too.

378
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Don’t you agree?

379
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,830
He is handsome.

380
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,275
In a down-to-earth style.

381
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,281
He is handsome, seriously.

382
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,012
I’m not sure of it with this scarf on.

383
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,848
It’s cool on you.

384
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,038
Now they are fixing each other’s clothes.

385
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:46,586
You scared me.

386
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,440
That’s the look.

387
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:53,072
The audience can now vote.

388
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:56,298
If you like a Thai romantic film, vote 1 for Nanon.

389
00:19:56,298 --> 00:20:00,799
If you like an international romantic film, vote 2.

390
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,267
Vote for Jack, write No.2.

391
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,981
Vote for Denchai, write No.1.

392
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,861
Now you all are dressed up.

393
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:08,422
I’ll take some pictures for you.

394
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:09,545
We look like the characters.

395
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:10,701
We do.

396
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,592
So we are wrapping up this episode with these two best friends

397
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:23,890
for this month of love.

398
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,209
We hope you all have a lovely relationship

399
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,822
like these two juniors of mine.

400
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:32,926
They agreed to join my show for this episode,

401
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,368
let’s thank them.

402
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,597
Thank you, Nanon. Thank you, Ohm.

403
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,912
Thank you.

404
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:44,298
We have to thank our kind sponsor too, The Baker, Your Everyday Artisan Bakery.

405
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:46,202
Thank you so much.

406
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:48,021
Us three, Arm, Ohm, and Nanon have to say Goodbye now.

407
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,471
Sawasdee krub.

408
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,533
I’m going with you.

409
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:02,096
Thank you, The Baker, Your Everyday Artisan Bakery.

410
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,947
Ohm, Nanon.

411
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,388
Hold on. Nanon enters first.

412
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:07,732
Welcome Nanon and Ohm.

413
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:10,702
Sawasdee krub.

414
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,574
What the?

415
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,290
You throw a gag right away?

416
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,582
He wanted to play this like what kids do.

417
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,767
You told me to do it.

418
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,945
No, I didn’t. I saw you folding a plane.

419
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,769
But the paper wasn’t made for it.

420
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,119
It’s the paper for bread and stuff.

421
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,166
Ah.

422
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,575
Here they go.

423
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,608
I can’t catch up with you guys.
